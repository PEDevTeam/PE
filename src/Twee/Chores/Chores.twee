				You look around the kitchen and at all the things $guardian wants you to do. There's no way you're slaving away like that.
				
				You dump as many dishes as you can into the sink, using the sprayer to hose off the obvious stuff. You squirt some dish soap in randomly, and then use the sprayer again to splash it around. Once everything is rinsed, more or less, you grab a nearby wash cloth and wipe off whatever's left, which also //mostly// dries things. You start shoving items into the drawers and cabinets as fast as you can, paying little attention to where things belong.

				Instead of taking time to sweep first or get a mop bucket ready, you just soak the mophead by sticking it under the faucet while the water's running. You pour some cleaner in it for the scent.

				Unfortunately, $guardian isn't fooled. She holds up a dish you supposedly washed to show you the numerous spots still on it, and points out the visible stains you left on the countertop and floor, and looks in the trash can. Her anger grows with each discrepancy.
			<<elseif $player.choreSpeed eq 1>>\
				Looking around the kitchen, the list of onerous tasks seems long. You've got to do them, though maybe a few shortcuts can save you time.
				
				The dishes seem to multiply on their own, but you dive in and quickly wash them. You work up some dish-soap lather, give each item a scrub with a sponge, and hose everything off with the sprayer. You speed the job up a little by rinsing handfuls of silverware or pairs of dinnerware all at once, but they all look pretty good unless you look closely. After you dry them, you put most of the dishes and utensils away where they belong, but the things that belong in hard-to-reach places you just drop in the first convenient spot.
				
				You give the sink a quick once-over with a rag instead of scrubbing it like you're supposed to, but it's basically clean. Then, you skip sweeping the floor to save a bit more time. Instead, you fill up the mop bucket with a mix of warm water and cleaning solution, and just start mopping. You swipe the mop over the floor, picking up most of the particles in the mophead, but any stains or bits that don't come up with a few rubs of the mop you just leave.
				
				Finishing up, you empty the mop bucket in the sink, rinsing anything left behind by splashing water at it from the faucet. You then take a rag out, wet it, and quickly wipe down the counters and the worst parts of the appliances. A few of the drips and splatters are tough to get off, but you don't linger long. Finally, you grab the trash bag and take it out, but skip putting in a new one because you know $guardian usually does it.
				
				Everything is mostly clean, so you pronounce the kitchen, 'good enough'.
				
				$Guardian immediately disagrees with your judgment. She hones in, laser-like, on every spot you didn't wipe, every crumb you left behind, every dish put in the wrong spot or not fully cleaned. She even looks in the trash can, and finding the liner missing actually sets her off the most, because she knows that it wasn't just sloppy - you left //your job// for her to do.
			<<elseif $player.choreSpeed eq 2>>\
				You decide to give the kitchen your full effort, thoughts of leisure time fun evaporating as you see everything you have to do. There's nothing for it except to get started.
				
				You fill the sink with hot, foamy suds and soak each item carefully, scrubbing in little circles with a sponge until completely free of spots. A few dishes in, you start getting distracted, thinking of the things you'd rather be doing instead. Your imagination takes over, and before you realize it, all the dishes are in the dish rack, but you aren't sure if they're actually done right. You start spotting problems mid-way through putting dishes away, so you re-wash what you catch, but you're not sure you find everything.

				Despite your best effort, your mind wanders once again as you clean the sink and counters with water and cleanser. You resolve to catch every splatter, drip or crumb, but you get lost in daydreams a few times. You even go over the metal in the sink with polishing cream, but it doesn't look as good as you planned when it's done.
				
				Resolving to do better with the floor, you sweep carefully before filling the mop bucket up, following the label instructions on the right mix of water and cleaning solution. However, you still catch yourself spacing out and have to go back over several areas before you're done. You do a second pass with the floor wax $guardian likes, hoping it'll help.
				
				At least the trash can is a no-brainer, and you're totally focused as you take the bag out to the garbage.
				
				$Guardian checks your work. While she acknowledges your effort, she finds discrepancy after discrepancy. You even remember, right before she checks, that you forgot to put a new trash liner in, and it pushes her over the edge because that's something you leave for her to do more often than not. She launches into a whole new round of criticism, and by the time she finishes, she's angry to the point of shouting. Still, you're most disheartened by the fact that this time, you actually tried to do it right, and failed anyway.

		You take out an arsenal of cleaning supplies and look over the bathroom, wondering how such a little room can contain such a large amount of unpleasant chores. Knowing $guardian will be looking at every detail, you steel yourself and just get to the task.

		The tub and toilet need the most attention. You're on your hands and knees for longer than any person should ever be, scrubbing away at stubborn, suspicious stains that you don't even want to think about. You get everything, even around the base of the toilet bowl and the corners of the bathtub, until the porcelain, tile and grout look their best again. You wash the entire shower curtain with some nasty-smelling mildew remover that makes you feel dizzy, then run the shower before drying everything again with a towel.
				
		You spray down the mirror with glass cleaner, your rag squeaking away until the glass looks flawless. You empty the cabinets, cleaning every object you take out of it, then wipe clean every shelf, corner, and cranny. You even wipe off the layer of dust on the sink trap, just in case $guardian looks.

		The sink takes a lot of extra attention due to its constant use. You scrub away dried toothpaste, strands of hair, flecks of cosmetics and god knows what else, until the ceramic is perfectly white. You use metal polish pads to restore all the chrome trim on the mirror and sink, until a flawless shine reflects your face.
		
		You clean every speck of dirt from the wall boards, taking a considerable amount of time to clear cobwebs and dust from the door frame and base trim. You spend a good deal more ridding the caulking of grime across the divide between the floor, walls and tub.
		
		The floor gets your attention next, and you go through a number of rinses and re-scrubs before some of the harsher stains come out of the seams. Your fingers throb by the time you've cleaned every tile and line of grout in the flooring.
		
		At last, you think the bathroom is done. It's sparkling clean and even smells nice. You shake off your soreness, take a breath, and get $guardian to look it over. You're glad you were thorough, because when she can't see anything you've missed, $guardian dares you to lick certain spots to prove they're clean enough.
		
		In the end, she's finally satisfied you did what you were supposed to. You are left aching and completely exhausted.
