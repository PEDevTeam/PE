	$Guardian looks at you with a subtle smirk.
	@@.guardian;"I'm starting to think you need some //extra// encouragement. Come with me, $player.name."@@
	
	Afraid of another spanking session, you meekly follow her as she goes to the bathroom.
	
<!-- NOTE: A variant of this also exists in Special punishments -->\
	$Guardian tells you to bend forward, and put your hands on the wall. A bit confused, you do as she says, feeling a bit silly as $guardian makes you shift your feet slightly away from the wall, transfering part of your weight to your arms.
	
	<<if _o and (not _o.female)>>\
		With one quick motion, $guardian unbuckles and lowers your pants.\
	<<elseif _o and _o.female>>\

	<<endif>>\
	You let out a surprised yelp as she\
	<<if _b>>\
	pulls out your plug and\
	<<endif>>\
	touches your anus with her fingers, covered by a rubber glove. Instinctively trying to back away from the intrusion, you realize that you are trapped in this position and you can't move without putting your foot forward, and $guardian easily prevents you from doing that.
	
	@@.guardian;"I think you spend too much time playing with your //toys//, so this will keep you occupied and help you stay healthy."@@

	You feel her fingers probe the outside of your back entrance, slick with some kind of ointment. Your anus starts tingling and heating up from the substance.\
	<<if _c>>\
	To your dismay, your penis strains in its cage from the growing stimulation it creates.
	<<else>>\
	To your dismay, your penis gets hard from the growing stimulation it creates.
	<<endif>>\
	Suddenly, you feel her finger easily sliding in your hole. You can't stifle a moan as intense sensations erupt from the sensation of the ointment rubbed across the ring sphincter of your anus. You whimper and bite your lip. Your knees wobble from the ordeal, and you desperately try to keep yourself from falling.
	
	Finally, $guardian finishes and give you a sound slap on your butt. You weakly try to cover yourself and slump down the wall in exhaustion despite the whole thing having taken just few minutes.
	
	@@.guardian;"You won't be able to play with your toys for a while. I hope that makes you learn your lesson."@@
	
	She turns around and leaves.

		"Apparently, it has all these sensors that evaluate everything you do to it. It can tell you exactly how it's responding, just like it was the real thing. It's scary, all the things they've worked out for it to check for. If it pans out like they think it will, they're planning to market it for medical training, prosthetics...
