		$friend grabs the remote and pulls up a movie that you have been wanting to see for like ever. You missed it at the cinema and it’s still on pay-per-view.

		@@.heroT;“Cool!”@@

		$friend pulls the snacks closer, dumps $friendG.his_her feet on the coffee table and presses play. The movie is great, everything you hoped it would be and more. You find yourself chatting animatedly about the characters and realize it’s already time to go home.

	You haven’t and you feel bad. @@.heroT;“Sorry, $friend, not had the time.”@@ If you didn’t know better, you’d think that $friend was acting a bit weird over a couple of manga, but ultimately shrug it off. Maybe $friendG.he_she just really wants them back soon. You make a note to get around to it though.
	
	@@.friend;“Oh, okay. I guess we’ll pick something else then,”@@ $friendG.he_she says, dejectedly sliding the mysterious disc away before grabbing the remote to select a movie.

	You cannot help but wonder just why $friend is so keen for you to read the comics.

	@@.hero;I should read them when I get home, I guess.@@

		@@.friend;“I thought we could watch this one,”@@ $friend says pulling a disc from the desk drawer, one with no writing on it. $friendG.He_She pops the disc into the player and the TV switches to the disc menu. It’s only got one title on it, and it looks like Russian or something. $friend returns to the couch and sits down right next to you so your legs are touching. 

		The quality of the film is not good, and the dubbing is almost laughable. You are surprised when you glance at $friendG.him_her and see how engrossed $friendG.he_she is. The film, some kind of sexploitation film, is essentially about a very pretty girl who is working as some kind of secretary. Then\
		<<if $friendG.gender eq 'M'>>a man walks in<<else>>another pretty girl appears<<endif>>, who looks not unlike $friend. 

		Within moments the pair on screen start to strip off and the secretary....

		@@.hero;Wait, she’s a shemale?@@

		You become engrossed in the film, not realising how turned on you are, despite the confusion of which of the people performing horizontal dancing on the screen you feel more affinity to.

		$friend offers you a fresh drink and scurries away.  Your skin is all tingly, your cheeks flushed and your penis is\

		You adjust trying to get comfortable before $friend returns. Fortunately $friendG.he_she suggests watching some random drama instead and you relax a little, although confusion still clouds your mind.

		$friend pulls up the menu on screen and enters a password which must have about fifty characters in it. 

		@@.hero;It must be something important, or secret,@@ you muse to yourself.

		Eventually a picture appears. It’s porn, but not some cheap foreign import or even one from a small distribution company. No, this has a set that doesn’t wobble and a real view out of the hotel window. In the mirror, you see the reflection of a girl who is wearing enticing underwear, with perfect makeup and cascades of hair that swishes seductively every time she moves. Then\
		<<if $friendG.gender eq 'M'>>an almost-naked man,<<else>>another pretty girl,<<endif>>\
		approaches from the en-suite door.  

		The girl on the bed lays back, and removes her delicate, lacy panties and...

		Suddenly, $friend climbs to $friendG.his_her feet and without a word rushes to the bathroom. You hear something which might have been…

		@@.hero;Oh!?@@

		Not sure quite what to do, you eventually decide to head home and leave the film playing as you leave, your mind full of all the positions they managed to get into…
