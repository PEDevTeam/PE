You are not sure what it is, but $friend seems a little edgy as $friendG.he_she waits for you to decide what to do.

@@.heroT;“What’s up?”@@ you ask,

@@.friend;“I-I-I was thinking…”@@ $friendG.he_she stammers, @@.friend;“I gave you some panties and then… Okay, I was wondering if you wanted to try something new.”@@

Heat builds in your cheeks at the suggestion. <<if _bra or _stock>>\

	You step back a little and sheepishly raise your top, revealing first your tummy and then the bottom of the bra you are still wearing. 

	@@.friend;“You wore that for me?<<if $friendG.gender == 'T'>> How does it feel? I’m jealous, I need to start wearing one too.<<endif>>”@@
	
	Instead of feeling repulsed by your bra, $friend seems genuinely happy and smiles rather than ridicules. You breathe a sigh of relief, and comply when $friendG.he_she asks you to remove your top. Before you can stop $friendG.him_her, $friendG.he_she whips out $friendG.his_her camera and dashes off a couple of pictures of you.

	Instead of feeling repulsed by your stocking leg, $friend seems genuinely happy and smiles rather than ridicules. You breathe a sigh of relief, and invigorated by $friendG.his_her reaction, you roll your <<if playerCode.isWearing(itemsC.casualMale)>>jeans<<else>>pants<<endif>> up to your knees. You feel a bit stupid with your <<if $body.bodyhair > 0>>waxed<<else>>hairy<<endif>> legs poking out, but before you can stop $friendG.him_her, $friendG.he_she whips out $friendG.his_her camera and dashes off a couple of pictures of you.

$friend scurries off to <<if $friendG.gender == "F">>her<<else>>his sister’s<<endif>> walk-in wardrobe and returns clutching a bra in $friendG.his_her trembling fingers. @@.friend;“I was trying to find the matching bra, you know, the one that goes with those panties I gave you, but I couldn’t find it. I have this, though. It should fit.”@@

Feeling guilty for doing $teacher’s tasks alone when $friend has been so helpful, you take the black and pink bra and remove <<if _bra>>the bra you're currently wearing<<else>>your top<<endif>>.

$friend also thrusts a pair of lacy panties into your hands.

@@.friend;“Here are the panties to go with it,"@@ $friendG.he_she says. @@.friend;"They will look cute on you. You’ve got to start being more adventurous on your visits though!"@@
