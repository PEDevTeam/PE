	The thought of going out in a dress and to such a public place makes your stomach flip a little, a mixture of nausea and something else. Something you can’t quite put your finger on, almost like a hidden anticipation. For the first time you are going to be dressed far away from the sanctity and safety of your home. Having $friend with you might be the only way you can get through this. 

	@@.friend;“What are you thinking of doing today?”@@ $friend asks.

	@@.hero;Oh nothing. I just need to dress up like a girl and go to a fucking park!@@

	@@.heroT;“Um. Can we go out?”@@

	@@.friend;“On a date?”@@ $friend asks, seemingly more curious than usual. 

	@@.heroT;“No, not a date. Like, to the park?”@@

	@@.friend;“Not a date, but to the park? You mean play ball or something?”@@ $friend asks. 

	@@.heroT;“I’d look pretty stupid throwing a ball in a dress and heels,”@@ you mutter to yourself.

	Without pausing, $friend rushes upstairs to <<if $friendG.gender == "F">>her<<else>>his sister’s<<endif>> walk-in wardrobe and pulls out a package that has Indy’s Closet Clothing Emporium written on the side.

		You look down, wondering what $friend is talking about, and blink dumbly at the sight of the telltale bulge of the chastity cage in your <<if _under.isFemale>>panties<<elseif _under.isMale>>boxers<<endif>>.
