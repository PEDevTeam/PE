	The thought of going out in a dress and to such a public place makes your stomach flip a little, a mixture of nausea and something else. Something you can’t quite put your finger on, almost like a hidden anticipation. For the first time you are going to be dressed far away from the sanctity and safety of your home. Having $friend with you might be the only way you can get through this. 

	@@.friend;“What are you thinking of doing today?”@@ $friend asks.

	@@.hero;Oh nothing. I just need to dress up like a girl and go to a fucking park!@@

	@@.heroT;“Um. Can we go out?”@@

	@@.friend;“On a date?”@@ $friend asks, seemingly more curious than usual. 

	@@.heroT;“No, not a date. Like, to the park?”@@

	@@.friend;“Not a date, but to the park? You mean play ball or something?”@@ $friend asks. 

	@@.heroT;“I’d look pretty stupid throwing a ball in a dress and heels,”@@ you mutter to yourself.

	Without pausing, $friend rushes upstairs to <<if $friendG.gender == "F">>her<<else>>his sister’s<<endif>> walk-in wardrobe and pulls out a package that has Indy’s Closet Clothing Emporium written on the side.

With a girlish squeak, your cover up with your hands, but $friend rushes over to you and grabs your wrists. $friendG.He_She is too strong for you to resist, and $friendG.he_she easily pulls your arms apart to expose your secret.

	“You know,” $friend says, throwing the bag back into the wardrobe and slamming the door. “If you’re not even doing the basics, I don’t know why you would want to go outside in a dress. This is not some game for me, and if you are not going to put the effort in, then I am not going to help. Think about it tonight, $player.name, and if you decide you want to continue having fun, put some effort into your appearance. If you do, we can go for a walk if you want.” $friend sounds angry and annoyed and somewhat disappointed. 

	I’d better check my outfit before I ask again, $friend wants me to wear things to put some effort in for [him/her]

	With $friend refusing to engage in anything other than grunts, you head home dejectedly, your task still outstanding.
