<<if $friendG.gender eq 'F'>>\
    You have some vague recollection of the two of you smearing makeup on each others’ faces when you were both about five, but just as part of playing house. You doubt she would remember anyway. \
    This is… different.

    $friend guides you over to her vanity and sits you down at the table. @@.friend;“Don’t worry, I can teach you.”@@

    She gathers some items and starts arranging them on the vanity.

    @@.heroT;“I thought, you know, I could record it. In case I wanted to try on my own?”@@ The lie sounds hollow on your lips, but $friend seems to buy it.

    She pushes you down onto the makeup stool and pulls up another chair to sit beside you. She is close, so close that you can smell her faint perfume, and her arm is pressed against yours.

    You turn your head to look at her and see that her face is free of makeup. In fact, you are not sure when the last time you even saw her in makeup was. \
    Even so, she is pretty in more than a girl-next-door way, and a stirring in your <<if _wearingBoxers>>boxers<<else>>panties<<endif>> confirms your attraction.

    As $friend gets out a couple of basic makeup sets, you angle the phone so she is not in the picture. She opens a makeup kit in front of you and you can see an array of powers and sticks and pencils \
    and other things spread inside. She has a similar one to you, but more used.

    @@.friend;“It’s a duplicate present. Never been opened,”@@ she explains. Besides the tray of makeup, she lines up some bottles, cotton pads and some pots of cream.

    When she has finished fidgeting and the paraphernalia is set out before you, you hit record on the phone. You concentrate on only looking at her reflection in the mirror. \
    The last thing you need is $teacher realising you got help.

    @@.friend;“The most important thing is skin care,”@@ $friend begins. @@.friend;“First you need to cleanse, wiping with the cleanser and a pad.”@@

    She takes her own tube of cleanser, spreads some on a pad and wipes her face.

    @@.friend;“Steady sweeps, focusing on cheeks, forehead, neck and then importantly around your nose and eyes and mouth.”@@

    Watching her first, you squirt out your own cleanser and wipe your face, horrified at how grimy the pad is after just a couple of wipes. \
    You catch $friend’s smile in the mirror and set to work with more gusto.

    Under her instruction, you finish the cleansing, use something to open your pores, then some moisturizer stuff, some pore closing oil and finally a primer.

    @@.friend;“Great. Now we can start the makeup. Oh, and you should do that routine every morning before you put your makeup on, and every evening when you take it off. \
    Although in the evening, of course, you need night creams and oils and not day ones.”@@

    @@.heroT;“Sheesh. I thought this would be easy,”@@ you mumble to yourself.

    You glance at the time on your phone and realise you have been going for fifteen minutes already and you haven’t touched makeup yet.

    @@.friend;“Now you have prepared your skin, it’s time to start applying your makeup. Take the concealer stick…”@@ You glance up in confusion and catch her smirk in the mirror. \
    She winks at you and then continues @@.friend;“which is the tube like a lipstick, but has skin-coloured makeup inside.”@@

    Now $friend has explained it, it’s easy to tell what you need. Paying attention to her intently, you follow her instructions for covering up a blotchy patch under your cheek and the redness \
    around your nose.

    Next she moves onto foundation, a liquid that she squeezes into a special brush, which has an indent in the top for the liquid to sit in. Following her guidance you apply the foundation sparingly \
    over your whole face, blending it in with circular swirls of the brush. Much to your amazement your face looks smooth and uniform in colour.

    Amazed at the difference already, you focus on contouring using four shades of blusher, from a dark tone below your cheeks to the lightest across the top of your cheeks, just below your eyes. \
    Using a thick brush you apply a bit of bronzer all around the edge your face, close to your hairline, although you are not sure why.

    @@.friend;“Time for eyes. These can be tricky,”@@ $friend says. @@.friend;“Take your time, and follow me. Take the white powder and apply it to your whole lid and up to your eyebrows. Good. ”@@

    @@.friend;“Now take the light grey and apply it to your whole lid. The medium grey, apply that from the centre of your lid to the outer, and finally take the dark gray and apply it to the corner of your eye, \
    both above and below. Yes, not too much, use a smaller brush if you need to. Great! ”@@

    @@.friend;“Now, using the thin brush, run it along the crease, to give definition. Then line with a kohl pencil and mascara on your lashes. And voila, which is French for, um, and you’re done.”@@

    It takes you three attempts, using a small cleansing pad to remove your bungled applications, but you eventually manage a respectable eye. The grey shimmers in the light as you move your head from side to side and you are amazed at the transformation. It looks completely different to your other eye, which you haven’t even started yet. You copy the technique and focus on making your eyes match.

    @@.friend;“Wow, great job!”@@ $friend announces with a huge smile.

    You look again at your eyes in the mirror and…

    Wondering what, or who, you have unleashed on the unsuspecting world, you follow under $friendsis’s ridiculously long vanity in her walk-in wardrobe. \
    Before you can sit down he moves to the drawers and starts to pull out some thin black plastic cases. $friend takes one for himself, and passes the other to you. It’s still wrapped in cellophane.

    @@.heroT;“Won’t she notice?”@@ you ask, somewhat dubious.

    @@.friend;“Nah, she left all this stuff behind when she went to school, so I don’t think she even wants it anyway. Besides, \
    it’s not like she’s got a registry of all the stuff she abandoned at our house.”@@

    You shrug and rip the cellophane, then open the box. Inside is an array of powers and sticks and pencils and other things spread inside. $friend has a similar one to you, but it’s been opened before. \
