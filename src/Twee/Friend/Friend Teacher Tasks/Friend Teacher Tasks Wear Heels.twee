::Friend Teacher Tasks Wear Heels
<<if not $friendG.girlinessAttempt>>\
    /* Intro */\
    $teacher’s requirement was very specific; wearing heels in the mall. No dresses, no skirts, no pantyhose, just heels. You could even wear them with your school uniform on, although as you peer at your uniform it’s not as manly as it used to be. And someone might recognize you, in your uniform wearing heels. 

    @@.hero;A dress again then,@@ you think, sighing in resignation. Despite everything, filming yourself in heels, in the mall feels like another large leap. Mixed with trepidation is an inner thrill. @@.hero;What if people see me in them? If heels really are as noticeable as $teacher says, there's no way I'll live this down.@@

    @@.friend;“What do you want to do today?”@@ $friend asks.

        Oh nothing. I just need to try and walk in heels, in public for some stupid task.

        Oh nothing. I just need to walk around the mall in heels. Won’t be my first time, but that doesn’t really make this any easier.  What if a girl notices me?
    <<elseif $player.heelsSkill >= 5>>\
        Oh nothing. I just need to wander around the mall in heels. It’s not like I have trouble with them at this point, but they definitely make my walking more… feminine. Thought, if I’m in a dress, maybe that’s a good thing?

    Without pausing, $friend rushes up to <<if $friendG.gender eq 'F' >>her<<else>>his sister’s<<endif>> walk-in wardrobe and pulls out some clothing $friendG.he_she has obviously already chosen for you. $friend passes you something denim. @@.hero;Jeans@@ you think, in relief. But, as you take it you realize that it’s not jeans but a dress, a really short one.

    @@.friend;“I thought we could go more casual, it’s just a mall. I saw a girl wearing one the other day, and I thought it would really suit you. Try it on”@@

    Knowing that you need to do the task to avoid upsetting $teacher, and remembering this was your idea, you strip down to your underwear.
