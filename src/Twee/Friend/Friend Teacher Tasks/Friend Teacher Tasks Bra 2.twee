You take the bra from $friendG.him_her and turn it around, trying to work out how the straps and cups work. You have peeked on $guardian before but never paid much attention to the actual clothing, more at her soft silky pillows before the bra cruelly hid them from view.

You wonder how you are going to manage to put it on.
