$friend opens the door and smiles widely at you before stepping back.

You stand on the doorstep nervously pondering how to broach the bra dilemma. Things have become worse, not better since your last visit. You smile wistfully as $friendG.he_she steps back and motions for you to climb the stairs.

You follow $friendG.him_her up to $friendG.his_her bedroom, but your heart isn’t in it.
