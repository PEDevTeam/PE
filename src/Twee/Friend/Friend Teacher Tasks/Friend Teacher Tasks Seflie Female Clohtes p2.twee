    You hold a frilly pink princess dress in your hands. It is light and floaty and the material is as soft as a peach.

    You hold a soft, pink garment in your hands. It feels snuggly in your hands and has a matching hood lined with fluffy material. As you hold it out you realise that it’s a hoodie dress, \
    and is very short. But it feels so good in your hands. You actually think you can remember <<if $friendG.gender eq 'F'>>$friend<<else>>$friendsis<<endif>> wearing it when she was younger.

    You hold the leather dress in your hands. It feels soft and supple and has an enticing smell. The exterior is shiny and sleek, but the inside a little fluffy and warm. \
    You know that it will hug you tightly like, well, like a leather glove.

    You hold the dress your hands. It feels soft and very girly in your hands, but light and enticing too. And, if you are honest with yourself, you want to see how it feels to wear it.

Unsure what to do, you stand there and hold the dress in bemusement, wondering if this were a good idea after all. It isn’t until \
<<if $friendG.gender eq 'F'>>\
    $friend stands before you, her arms crossed angrily beneath her luscious, smooth and enticing breasts that you are shaken into action.\
\
<<elseif $friendG.gender eq 'T'>>\
    $friend stands before you, looking down at you with his arms folded beneath his bra. He smiles reassuringly and touches the dress the dress you are holding. He seems to be waiting for you to decide.
\
<<else>>\
    $friend smiles at you in encouragement. You glance down at his prone form and see a bulge in the front of his jeans, evidence of his own thoughts. \
    Perhaps you have a sliver of an exhibitionist in you, but you determine then to just put the damned dress on.
\
<<endif>>\

You lay the dress back down and remove your <<if playerCode.isWearing(itemsC.casualMale)>>shirt and jeans<<elseif playerCode.isWearing(itemsC.schoolMale)>>uniform<<endif>>.

\
Encouraged by $friend’s enthusiasm, you pick up the dress. Initially you are unsure whether to put it on like a top or step into it like trousers. \
In the end, you just decide to  pull it on over your head. It’s snug against your torso, although a little baggy where your breasts should be, and decidedly loose around your legs, \
like you are not wearing anything at all.

As you move around, you can see why girls are constantly pulling the hems of their skirts and dresses down. The garment constantly tickles the backs of your legs as you walk, and rides up at the front.

You pace back and forth, trying to determine how you feel about it when $friend speaks, interrupting your thoughts.

$friend reaches over and grabs $friendG.his_her phone. You are about to object when you remember you are supposed to be doing a task for $teacher. Instead of complaining you let $friendG.him_her \
take several snaps as you walk up and down, and then take more on your phone too.

$friend pockets $friendG.his_her phone and hands you yours back. The angle looks a bit off but there are at least a couple you can use. Job done, you check the clock and realize it’s already time to \
leave. You shrug yourself out of the dress and pass it back to $friendG.him_her.
