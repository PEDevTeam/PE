For some reason, the thought of wearing stockings feels like a whole new level compared to just wearing panties. Sure, you can still hide them under pants, \
but when you handle the ones that $guardian wears when doing the laundry, they definitely feel different to your socks. Sadly, $guardian has too few pairs for you to just swipe some during your chores.

@@.heroT;“I was thinking, it might be, um, interesting to, you know, try some stockings?”@@ you say. You cringe at your own admission and wait for $friend to laugh at you.

With that, $friend rushes from $friendG.his_her room and along the corridor.  $friendG.He_She bypasses $friendsis’s room and ducks into her parent’s suite instead. \
You follow behind, not quite sure how you feel. $friend’s mom is certainly attractive, and has amazing legs. But to try on her things… your penis twitches at the thought and you realise \
how much wearing something that belongs to $friendG.his_her mother is extremely arousing.

$friendG.His_Her parents’ suite is bigger than the entire ground floor of your house. It’s decadent, with white bedding and red accents, and you feel like you should have a shower before you enter. \
$friend has no such compunctions and heads directly to the walk-in closet.

$friend lifts a small selection from the drawer, each pair still in its packet, and sorts through them.

@@.friend;“These should be okay. They kind of look like socks a bit, I guess. You should be able to wear any under your uniform.”@@

You thumb through the choice, not really sure which one to try. While the idea of wearing something so definitely feminine makes your stomach turn, it also leaves you with a sense of wonder.

    running away.

    Oblivious to your confused state, $friend continues. @@.friend;“There are different thicknesses for different weather conditions. And of course, you need different colours and styles because each \

    she continues, taking an expensive-looking packet from the drawer.

    @@.friend;“Usually hold-up stockings, or pantyhose if you have a short skirt. Of course, if you are feeling a bit slutty, stockings go with short skirts too!” @@

    I’ll show you how.”@@

    $friend tugs off her socks, revealing her delicate feet, with ten neatly trimmed nails, all painted red like little cherries. She unfastens her belt, unzips her fly and peels her tight jeans down her \
    slender, smooth and toned legs. As she bends over to pull them over her feet you get the perfect view of her cute butt encased in the red lacy panties you saw in the selfie she sent.
