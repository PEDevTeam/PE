    Without pausing, $friend walks to $friendG.his_her sister’s walk-in wardrobe and begins sorting through the furthest rails which are full of bright colored dresses and a seemingly endless shimmer of glitter. Knowing that you asked for help, you strip down to your underwear.

        $friend takes one for himself, no less revealing than the ones he laid out for you, and begins stripping off his clothes. His body is encased in white, in clothing you haven’t seen before. He is wearing a white bra, matching suspender belt and a lacy bodysuit over the top. You cannot help but notice how smooth his skin is, and how girly his long, smooth legs look encased in the sheen of his white stockings. He keeps his underwear on, his sizeable cock bulging against the lace, and shrugs the sky blue dress over the top. You are mesmerized by the vision and your penis twitches in its cage as you gaze at his silky skin.

        $friend opens a different section of wardrobe and removes a suit. She strips off her jeans and top, revealing a deep red bra and panties set which hugs her curves perfectly. You cannot help but notice how smooth and alluring her skin is, and how enticed you are by her thigh gap. You glance at the mirror and realize your thighs have the same shape. You blush at the realization and your gaze switches between you and $friend. You are mesmerized by the vision and your penis twitches in its cage as you gaze at her body.
    <<elseif $friendG.gender eq 'M' >>\
        $friend heads back to his room, returning later with smart pants and a shirt, as well as shiny dress shoes. He strips down to his underwear, pulling his t-shirt over his head, revealing his smooth, toned and sculpted body. You cannot help but look as he removes his top, mesmerized by the bulge in his speedos. You are mesmerized by the vision and your penis twitches in its cage as you gaze at his toned physique, then remember where you are and blush.

    You drag your eyes away from watching $friendG.him_her change, and finish dressing yourself. The indecently short length of the skirt barely covers the bottom of your panties and you feel exposed, adding to the pressure of your penis in your cage.
