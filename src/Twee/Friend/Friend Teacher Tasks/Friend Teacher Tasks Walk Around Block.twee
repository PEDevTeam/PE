	Going out in a dress seems like a big step, but in addition to fear, you feel an inner thrill inside, lessening your resistance. At least going for a walk from $friend’s house means none of your neighbors will recognise you. 

	@@.friend;“What’s on your mind?”@@ $friend asks.

	@@.hero;Oh nothing. I just need to dress up like a girl and go for a walk outside!@@

	@@.heroT;“Do you want to go out?”@@

	Without pausing, $friend tears upstairs into $friendG.his_her sister’s walk-in wardrobe and pulls out a package that has Indy’s Closet Clothing Emporium written on the side. Knowing that you need to do this to avoid upsetting teacher, and remembering this was your idea, you strip down to your underwear.

With a girlish squeak, your cover up with your hands, but $friend rushes over to you and grabs your wrists. $friendG.He_She is too strong for you to resist, and $friendG.he_she easily pulls your arms apart to expose your secret.
