					The room beyond momentarily confuses your mind. It’s at least fifteen meters on a side, likely a twin of the house’s pool area, with the white walls seeming to flicker when you look at them. One half of the room is laid out with furniture straight from a flatpack store showroom, and the other is empty. A cluster of lounge furniture is set in one corner with a massive bed large enough for at least four people opposite. In between what is obviously a baby’s bed and dresser set, only the crib and dresser is massive, towering over the rest of the stuff.

			You stand unmoving for a few seconds, not trusting yourself to speak. $friend reaches into the lower drawer and pulls out a clean diaper, the cute pink bunny suit, something white and soft-looking, a bottle and a pacifier from the collection of stuff in the drawer then slides it shut. 

			After a couple of moments, you relent and raise your hands for the clothing, only $friend pulls them back. @@.friend;“I thought… you know… Maybe I could help you? Make sure it’s tight and secure.”@@

			@@.friend;“<<if $kinkAllow.wetting>>You kinda did a bit of an accident on the chair last time. <<endif>>It must be hard, you know, to do your own…”@@

			Your cheeks flush in embarrassment as you realize what $friendG.he_she just said, and what you left for $friendG.him_her to clean up. No wonder $friend moved everything down here, you realize with shame, your <<if _chastity>>caged <<endif>>penis presses against your <<if _chastity>>cage<<elseif _under && _maleUnder>>boxers<<elseif _under>>panties<<else>>clothes<<endif>>, twitching at the memory of a diaper around your body. Unable to speak, you nod.

			$friend pushes the ladder to the side of the drawers and beckons you to clamber up. You do as instructed, discovering a plastic pad laid out on the top. 

			“You should remove your clothes and pass them to me,” $friend says huskily, clambering up behind you and pulling some items from the top drawer. Keeping your back to $friendG.him_her you slowly undress, until you are naked<<if _under && _maleUnder>>bar your boxers<<elseif _under>>bar your panties<<elseif _chastity>> bar your cage<<endif>>. Without speaking, $friend pulls you by the shoulder and eases you back on the plastic changing mat, not making any effort to move your hands from your <<if _chastity>>caged penis<<elseif _under && _maleUnder>>boxers<<elseif _under>>panties<<else>>naked penis<<endif>>.

			<<if _under>>\ 
				Slowly, as if asking for permission, $friend loops $friendG.his_her thumbs inside the waistband of your <<if _under && _maleUnder>>boxers<<elseif _under>>panties<<endif>> easing them down from your butt to your upper thighs, giving you a moment to whip your hands over your <<if _chastity>>caged <<endif>>penis for modesty before pulling your underwear fully down your <<if not playerCode.isHairy()>>baby-smooth <<endif>>legs.
				
			<<endif>>\
			$friend fiddles with a small packet, removes a wet wipe, and slowly wipes around your pubic area and upper thighs, paying special care drawing soft wipes along your perineum. You shiver, and through partially-open eyes catch a glimpse of $friend’s flushed complexion and shallow breathing as $friendG.he_she focuses on your most intimate areas. 

			When you reach the point where you can’t take it any longer, $friend backs away, only to begin caressing your body again, this time with $friendG.his_her fingers, coated in cold cream. You gasp in shock, partially pulling away from the cold gloop, only to be tugged back into place by your ankles. Pinning you across your waist and locking your arms in place, $friend continues to apply a generous amount of cream, somehow managing to avoid touching your <<if _chastity>>cage<<else>>penis<<endif>>. Your mind explodes with images of $friend doing that, of taking your <<if $kinkAllow.smallPenis>>tiny <<endif>>penis in $friendG.his_her fingers and slowly massaging you until you cum. The imagery makes your penis twitch in your <<if not _chastity>>hands, leaking precum on your fingers<<else>>painfully in your cage<<endif>>, however $friend continues to cream your butt and pubic area as if oblivious to your arousal.

			$friend opens a pink diaper, covered in princesses and unicorns, and slides the back under your creamed butt. After pulling the Velcro sides into place, $friendG.he_she pulls the front up, pushing your hands away from your <<if _chastity>>caged <<endif>>penis, and settles the diaper into place. $friend fastens the diaper tightly into place, much more snug than you can manage on your own, and gives your <<if _chastity>>caged <<endif>>penis one last pat.

			<<RandomImageFromPack 'Friend/PrincessPinkDiaper' 300 300 alignRight>>\
			Sitting up, you allow $friend to pull the pink bunny onesie over your head and pull it down your body. Before $friendG.he_she poppers it into place, however, $friend produces the white bundle with a flourish. “It can get a little cold down here,” $friendG.he_she says, unfurling the cloth to reveal a pair of thick white, ribbed tights. Without waiting for permission, $friend begins rolling them up your <<if not playerCode.isHairy()>>baby smooth <<endif>>legs, tugging the top over your diaper, then pressing the onesie closed over the top. “There, your [<<if $kinkAllow.sph>>tiny <<endif>>peepee is all changed and clean, like a good little girl. Let’s play!” 
						
			Clambering down the ladder is precarious as you waddle down to the floor. Every step, your diaper presses against you, and you know your peepee as $friend called it, is leaking precum into your diaper. By the time you reach the crib, $friend has already lowered the side and helps you climb up onto the soft mattress. 

			You can’t help but run your fingers over your white, baby tights, running a <<if playerCode.haveManicure>>manicured <<endif>>nail along the ribs. Encased in so many soft materials, and the comfort of your pretty diaper around your peepee, you find a sense of calm, relaxing as $friend heads to the HOPE dollhouse for $friendG.his_her turn. <<if $kink.wetting>>So calm, you let a stream of hot pee fill your diaper, relishing the warmth as the padded material grows heavy around your peepee and butt.<<endif>>

			Almost oblivious to the game, you take the bottle when it’s offered and fall asleep until hometime, when it’s time to change back.

			$friend is already dressed for another experience of HOPE, and leads you to the game room at the back of $friendG.his_her hidden girl cave. Without speaking, and with flushed cheeks, $friendG.he_she beckons you to the ladder up to the changing mat. 

			Your mind blazes with the thoughts of last time, $friendG.his_her hands on your skin, carefully applying the cream and wiping you down, the snugness of your diaper, the feel of the baby onesie tight against your body, the soft woolly tight against your <<if not playerCode.isHairy()>>baby smooth <<endif>>legs. Unable to resist, you strip down to your <<if _under && _maleUnder>>boxers and<<elseif _under>>panties and<<elseif _chastity>>cage and<<else>>penis, covering your modesty as you<<endif>> clamber up the ladder.

			As before, $friend <<if _under>>removes your <<if _maleUnder>>boxers<<else>>panties<<endif>>, then <<endif>>slowly and carefully wipes your butt and pubic area, slowly cleansing your skin. Next is the cold splodge of cream, still a shock even though you were braced for it, a little babyish whimper escaping your mouth before you can control it. $friend pauses, caressing your cheek and hushing you, before pushing a bottle filled with milk formula into your mouth. You suckle on the drink, allowing $friend to take control, the familiar calmness settles over you as $friendG.he_she tightens your fresh diaper around your body.

			As you glance at the white and pink onesie and tiny matching skirt, a small part of you wonders how you got here, from a normal boy to being babified and diapered. After the briefest of pauses, you decide it doesn’t matter and help $friend dress you in the cute outfit, matching tights and even a pair of tiny cloth booties.

			A grainy image forms on the screen, followed by a menu. $friend selects the mysterious Chapter 8 and settles back on the couch next to you, ignoring your <<if playerCode.isHairy()>>hairy<<else>>smooth<<endif>> legs sticking out from your diaper. Onscreen, a brunette girl, likely eighteen or perhaps a bit older, is having breakfast with her mother. Someone knocks at the door and another girl, presumably her friend, joins the pair. The two girls hug, before the daughter leaves to brush her teeth and fetch her stuff. The moment they are alone the mother turns to the girl’s friend and taps the table. The girl shakes her head at first, but then, seemingly reluctantly, clambers on the table so her lower legs dangle off the edge.

			The mother eases the girl’s short skirt up, revealing plastic panties covered in cartoon princesses with a diaper underneath. The girl lays back while the mother removes the diaper, cleans the girl with a wet wipe, and dries her off with a white fluffy towel. 

			You are not sure where to look, but your penis is <<if not _chastity>>rock hard, pressing against the softness of your diaper<<else>>pushing painfully against your cage<<endif>> as you watch the two women. Fortunately, your erection is hidden within by the thick padding.

			You watch amazed as the mother meticulously applies cream to the girl’s waxed pubic mound, gliding her fingers inside the girl’s lips. The girl gasps at the touch, and the mother reacts immediately pushing a pacifier into her mouth. The girl suckles as the mother teases the girl, applying cream on and around her clitoris, caressing the insides of the girl’s smooth thighs, and teasing the girl. Soon, she gasps around her pacifier, her back arches and she shudders in an orgasm. The girl tries to reach down with her hands, but the mother is quicker, and whips up the diaper, fastening it in place. The girl flops back in defeat and allows the mother to replace her panties. By the time the daughter returns, the diapered girl has replaced her clothing and is sipping juice like nothing had just happened.

			The scene leaves you with a pure mix of emotions. There’s no doubt the girl was cute, and her tiny, slender body in her short dress alluring. But that secret beneath her dress, the cute diaper a little like the one you are wearing now, is the icing on the cake. You realize your <<if $kinkAllow.smallPenis>> tiny<<endif>> penis is leaking precum into your diaper and you make your excuses and return to the bathroom and your clothing, disposing of the diaper in the trash before joining $friend in the bedroom. The dollhouse is covered over, and $friend, looking somewhat flushed, agrees it's time for you to go.

			$friend is already dressed for the another experience of HOPE, although most of the noticeable changes are in the lower areas of the dollhouse. $friend seems to be concentrating on the basement area, making a pool to hold water and another area which is hidden behind a panel. 

			A new diaper, pastel blue with a large whale figure on the front is waiting for you. As before, you head to the bathroom, strip below the waist and luxuriate in the sensation as your fresh diaper settles into place around your <<if _chastity>>caged<<endif>>, snuggling against your skin, caressing your butt and groin as you move.

			You follow $friend upstairs and into $friendG.his_her bedroom, which is unusually messy for such a neat-freak. The epicenter of the untidy explosion is at the far end, where the furniture has been pushed to the sides and heaped with discarded magazines, books, board games and computer cartridges. $friend’s laptop is open, but facing away from the door, and connected to a printer. Scissors, glue, colored markers and pencils are scattered on the floor between a small forest’s worth of chopped, colored and printed paper, but the strangest thing is the white sheet draped over something dominating the space, it’s top shaped like a tent.

You lift one of the tiles from an upper room. @@.heroT;“You’ve been a naughty boy, no supper.

			It’s an ambitious project; there must be over twenty rooms, and at least a dozen figures in each color, covering various ages. They’re freakishly people-like, as though $friend has molded them from plastic by hand. As you examine them more closely, you realize there are blue, pink and purple boy ones, pink, turquoise and blue girl ones, plus some which look like a gender mixture, and they range from tiny, like ‘one year old’ or something, through to ‘old person with a cane’. @@.hero;$friendG.He_She has put a lot of effort in,@@ you muse, fingering the tiny boy figure. @@.heroT;“How do we play?”@@

The sports bra is easy to put on, with the clasp at the front, between where your breasts would be if you had them. The dress slides over your shoulders, but the zip at the back takes some wriggling to pull up. Immediately the form-hugging dress gives you a strong hint of a waist. The socks are ridiculously short, and barely come up to your ankle bones, the tops just visible above the top of the tennis shoes.

			@@.friend;”I remember when $friend.sister bought that, for some Halloween thing. But… wow, it fits you.”@@

			You turn and see $friend’s flushed expression. @@.hero;Did $friendG.he_she just lick $friendG.his_her lips?@@

			Still flustered, $friend takes your hand and guides you back to the game, although seemingly $friendG.his_her mind is on other things and you find yourself wearing the tight cheer costume until it's time to go home, the tight material reminding you what you chose to wear every time you move. 

			You stand to leave, checking on the time, but before you reach the bathroom to change back, $friend gathers you into a tight embrace. <<if $friendG.gender == "F">>Her hands almost caress your back through the sheer material, and somehow she presses her groin against your thigh before pulling back.<<else>>His arms wrapping tightly around you, pulling you close, the unmistakable weight of his larger cock against your thigh, the throbbing noticeable through his <<if $friendG.gender == "T">>skirt<<else>>jeans<<endif>>.<<endif>> 
		<<elseif $friendG.HOPE == 2>>\
			$friend is already dressed for the another experience of HOPE, although most of the noticeable changes are in the lower areas of the dollhouse. $friend seems to be concentrating on the basement area, making a pool to hold water and another area which is hidden behind a panel. 

			The cheer outfit is waiting for you on the hanger, so you head to the bathroom, strip down and pull the new pantyhose on before dressing in the cheer outfit. 

			You join in a game of ping-pong in the games room, try alcohol twice more - and experience a pina colada for the first time - and win more game cash. But no more changes of clothing. The outfit is not too bad, although $friend does seem to look at you, especially your legs, a whole lot. 

			@@.hero;I guess the outfit is not too bad, it’s comfortable and kinda cute. Wow, where the fuck did that thought come from? You shake your head in self-admonishment.@@

			When it’s time to go, you change back into your own clothes and prepare to leave. $friend, for $friendG.his_her part, hugs you tightly as you gather your things to leave.
