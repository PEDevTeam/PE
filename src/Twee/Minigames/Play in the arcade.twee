The arcade is filled with all sorts of video games and skill testers.  A sign out front says:

<div class="sign">Due to our prize cabinet keys having gone missing, all tickets will be paid out in cash.<br><br>Management apologizes for any inconvenience.</div>
Awesome! Cash is better than prizes any day.

All the games cost $1. \
