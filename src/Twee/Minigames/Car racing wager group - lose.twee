:: Car racing wager group - lose [pos_2244_2636]
\
The group of boys look at each other, nod and agree, and you all put your money on the console.

Even before you start, it's obvious these boys have all played this game before, and they quickly leave you behind. After a few minutes of trying to catch up, you cross the finish line in last place, and look over to see the winner scooping up the pile of money with a smile.

Maybe if you were a better <b>gamer</b> you'd have a better chance of beating them?
