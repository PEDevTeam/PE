You take out your wallet and show the contents to $teacher, suggesting there might be an alternate arrangement.

She takes a quick glance at how much money you have, but just laughs coldly.

You hurriedly put your wallet away.

@@.teacher;"Now, $player.name, I have given a lot of thought to what you tried earlier. I am insulted you think you could buy your way out of trouble with some pocket change."@@

You can't risk being expelled - she's got your balls and she knows it.
@@.hero;Crap.@@

@@.teacher;"I suspect you may have some trouble coming up with that much money every week, so I'll reduce it if you show some humility."@@ Sounds worrying...

@@.teacher;"For every day you wear female underwear to school, I will take $<<print rewardMoney.teacherFemaleUnderwear>> off your week's payment."@@

@@.hero;What? I have to wear panties to school? Is she serious?!@@
	
You open your mouth to argue, but miffle out under $teacher's hard glare and just nod instead.

Frustrated and embarrassed for chickening out you try to convince yourself that it's not a big deal. You just hope that noone would find out about it.
