	$teacher smiles when you give her your response.
	
	@@.teacher;"I am glad to hear you're embracing your sexual nature. It seems your instruction is paying off."@@
	
	$teacher hands you a small package, which you open to reveal a fetishized school girl outfit.

	The tip of your chastity cage will be clearly visible under the slutty microskirt, letting everyone know what kind of a perverted sissy you are.

	The stripperific blouse will cover less skin than some bras, making it look like you walked straight from a porn shoot and were down to fuck with the next guy who asks.

	A mockery of a necktie and fishnet stockings complete the outfit, both looking like they would fit a role-playing stripper better than a teenager attending school.

	Overall, this 'uniform' sends a clear message to everyone around that you are the school slut, shouting that fact in the most shameless and debasing way possible.

	Somehow, you find yourself excited by the mere thought of putting it on and strolling around the school halls, feeling the hot eyes on your flesh and hearing the catcalls of your classmates.

	@@.teacher;"From now on, this is your school uniform. Don't worry about getting in trouble for violating the dress code. I have so much video evidence of your deviancy that I had no trouble getting you diagnosed with 'nymphomania.' With that diagnosis, you'll be exempt from the dress code, and the rules regulating sexual conduct. 
	
	Of course, I will be expecting you to live up to your role of 'school slut' from now on. I am sure you can find opportunities to offer your services to those at school if you look hard enough, and if you give students or faculty a nice relief, I will give you a little debt relief. I will also pass along if I hear of anyone who needs your particular services, but I expect you to show some initiative and seek them out.@@
