		You nervously show up for your next training class, knowing that you missed the party $teacher told you to attend. As you walk through the door, $teacher smiles at you in a way that only enhances your apprehension.
		
		@@.teacher;"$player.name, I gave you explicit instructions not to ignore the party on Saturday, and yet you seem to have willfully ignored my orders. Considering your blatant disregard for these classes, you will have a remedial class today. I have just the plan for how to drill it into your thick skull how a proper lady should behave. You may start by removing your clothes, I have a different outfit in mind to properly set the mood.‚Äù@@

Not only did you ignore your lesson, but you disappointed $flags.bimboLessonPartner. By now, you should understand that skipping your classes is inexcusable.
