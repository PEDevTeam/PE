	You walk into the classroom to find about a dozen of your fellow students milling about. From what you can tell from the doorway, it looks to be a sausage-fest.

	Chairs have been arranged around a large television screen for what you guess is going to be a viewing party. The show hasn’t started yet and several different conversations are going on at once. Upon noticing your arrival, silence spreads through the room as all eyes turn towards you. Most of the guys are looking at you with naked lust, and no wonder, given your current slutty attire. One guy, however appears more stern as he breaks the silence.

	@@.malevoice1;“So, you looking to join, or you just stumble in here on accident?”@@ he asks. From his tone, it sounds like the later is the more expected response, which isn’t surprising given that most “girls” would probably be put off by the way the whole club is blatantly ogling you.

	All the attention has you feeling nervous, as if you have barged in on some private goings-on, but you mumble that you were looking to join the club.

	@@.malevoice2;“Cool,”@@ another guy replies in a breathless whisper. There is no mistaking the of arousal in his voice… or his hungry stare.

	@@.malevoice1;“Not so fast,”@@ states the first guy, who you conclude is some sort of ringleader for this rag-tag collection of nerds. @@.malevoice1;“If you want to join this club you need to prove that you aren’t some weeb wannabe.”@@

	@@.femvoice6;“Yeah, no fake poseur nerd girls here!”@@ a female voice chips in. You hadn’t seen her at first but in response to her outburst the boys around her part to give you a direct view of her in all of her curvy, sexy glory.

	Well-endowed above and below, she's pretty hot and is clearly showing off with her best features by wearing a too-short, too-tight uniform. She strikes a pose with one hand on her hip to draw further attention to her assets, and you can tell instantly from the way she glares death at you that she doesn’t like the idea of sharing her space with another girl. The members of the club all nervously shift as they look away from you and acknowledge her objection.

	@@.hero;I wonder what she’d say if she knew what was dangling between my legs…@@

	Adding the final line with a flourish, you step back with a smile, only to find yourself holding your breath as attention shifts to other girl - who you are now quite certain holds the actual power in the club.

		Other than being gagged, you are not immediately tormented any further. However, after a few minutes of sitting in the dark room with your new “friends,” a hand reaches out to stroke your thigh.

		The first time you feel a touch, you let out a gasp but a raised eyebrow and a @@.femvoice6;“Shh”@@ from the girl sitting next to you is sufficient scolding to have you endure the rest of the episode in silence as the emboldened hands of unseen club members grope your body.
	<<else>>\
		Sitting next to the other girl, the lights go down and the show starts playing. You’ve barely gotten past the “on last week’s episode” intro when you feel a hand sliding up your thigh.

		Instinctively, you look towards the girl but she merely smiles, placing a finger to her lips in a silencing motion as her hand moves up your thigh and another gropes your rear.

		Too scared to do anything, you just sit there, trying to sit quietly with your legs together and focus on the anime as unseen hands roam over your body.
