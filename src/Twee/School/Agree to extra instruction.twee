Not having a clue about what she said, you just nod once, your expression sullen and your will defeated.

@@.teacher;“Never let it be said that I am not fair."@@ She looks you up and down. @@.teacher;"My instruction will not be easy, but assuming you learn some humility, I believe you will be a worthwhile investment...”@@

@@.hero;Investment? Is she trying to hint that she wants to be paid for her tutoring? I mean, most people pay for that, right?@@

<<if $player.money>0>>\
	You reach into your wallet and pull out all the cash inside. @@.heroT;“I, uh, can give you $player.money dollars.”@@
<<else>>\
	@@.heroT;“I could pay you, once I make some money, I guess…”@@
<<endif>>\

She seems almost offended, but you’re unsure if it’s due to the fact that you just offered her money or <<if $player.money >0>>how little you offered<<else>>your current lack of it<<endif>>.

@@.teacher;“$player.name, you know that no amount of money will cause me to look past your misdeed in the hallway, but I suppose we could come up with some sort of arrangement for my time as a //special// instructor. The rate for my help, as well as my discretion, is $bribeAmount dollars a week. This is to be paid each Monday. If you fail to make your payments, then our deal is off and the principal will hear about your actions.  Is that understood?@@

You nod timidly.

@@.teacher;"Good. I would hate to see you expelled when you are clearly capable of redemption.\
<<if $player.bribeDiscount gt 0>>\
	Since it's already <<print window.timeCode.weekDayText()>>, I will reduce this week's amount by $<<print $player.bribeDiscount>>, to $<<print _nb>>. \
<<endif>>\
<<if $flags.bullySteal>>\
	I will also stop those $futa.boy_girl////s from stealing your money in the morning. \	
<<endif>>\
If these payments are too expensive for you, I will deduct $<<print rewardMoney.teacherFemaleUnderwear>> from the week’s amount for each day you wear female underwear to school.”@@

@@.hero;What? I have to wear panties to school? Is she serious?!@@

@@.teacher;“I don’t care where you obtain them from,”@@ she adds with a dismissive wave of her hand, @@.teacher;“perhaps your mother, a friend or buying your own from the shops if you are feeling brave. Who knows, you might even be able to borrow some from a //girlfriend//...”@@ she adds with a slight smile playing on her lips. @@.teacher;"What's important is that you show some obedience."@@

$teacher pauses for a moment longer, intently watching your expression as the gravity of her offer hit you. 

@@.teacher;“The choice is clear, $player.name. You pay for my services and submit to my instruction, or we can discuss this matter with the principal…”@@
