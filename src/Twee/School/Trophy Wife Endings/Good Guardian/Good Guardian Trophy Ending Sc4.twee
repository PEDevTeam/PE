::Good Guardian Trophy Ending Sc4
You arrive at the restaurant and $teacher walks you past the maitre’d, who simply smiles and nods in acknowledgement as you stride into the dining room. As $teacher promised, every eye in the place is locked onto you, making you extremely self-conscious as you try to follow $teacher to your table.

<<if $player.ending.comportment.classStatus[1] == 5>>\
	Unfortunately, your nervousness quickly clouds your memory of proper, feminine movement, and in a moment of utter clumsiness, your stiletto catches on the grooves between the tiles in the restaurant’s floor. Your leg slips from under you, and you awkwardly tumble to the floor, limbs splayed in all directions. Even worse, you are certain you gave a group of nearby businessmen a full view beneath your dress, judging from their slightly-too loud chuckling.

	$teacher merely shakes her head and pulls you to your feet, offering her arm to steady you as she guides you to a door at the back of the room.
<<else>>\
	You practically glide as you move alongside $teacher, your movements perfect and enticing. As you pass a group of businessmen, you notice their conversation stops and they practically freeze in place, stunned by the pair of beauties crossing the room. It is not until one of them spills the contents of their fork into their laps that the spell breaks, and you quietly giggle at the power you seem to have been granted by $teacher’s instruction.

	$teacher, on the other hand, shows no reaction to the men’s attention, and silently leads you towards a door at the back of the dining room.

The door leads to a narrow stairwell, which you ascend to find yourself in a small room. The room is lit with a large chandelier and ornate candelabras along the side walls, and across from the stairs is a massive glass window with a balcony accessible through French doors. Inside the room is a single dining table, at which $guardian is already seated.

Even though you have seen $guardian prepare for several dates in the past, you have never seen her looking as magnificent as this. She wears a floor-length, diaphanous dress that pools around her like liquid obsidian. The tulle bodice of the dress gathers over her right shoulder and leaves her arms and back bare, save for the single shoulder strap, and offers tantalizing glimpses of the sides of her magnificent breasts.

@@.guardian;“My god!”@@ she whispers in awestruck wonder as she sees you, covering her mouth with her hand. For a moment, you’re concerned the trip to the salon was too much, but as you approach, she stands and rushes towards you. @@.guardian;“You look amazing!”@@ she says as she runs her hands down your arms, causing you to blush. She takes your hand and practically pulls you to the table. @@.guardian;“You have to see this menu!”@@ she adds excitedly. @@.guardian;“I don’t think I could even pronounce half these dishes.”@@

$teacher laughs in amusement and takes a seat, before greeting $guardian and striking up small talk.\

	You quickly interject yourself, attempting to give $guardian an awkward compliment on her own appearance. However, $teacher’s glare quickly shames you to silence.

	@@.teacher;“I apologize,”@@ $teacher says to $guardian. @@.teacher;“It seems this sissy’s etiquette lessons failed to take as well as I had hoped.”@@

	$Guardian laughs. @@.guardian;“Not to worry. I’m sure a firm swat to her backside later will help her remember her place.”@@

	$teacher grins. @@.teacher;“Certainly, or, perhaps, I should share with you a few correction methods we have been practicing at school.”@@

	$Guardian’s face lights up, and you quickly open your mouth to object, only to find your complaint stifled by a quick look of admonishment from $teacher. As the first course of the meal arrives, $teacher begins to regale $guardian with her most devious ideas for punishments. Each course brings a new <<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>tortuous <<elseif playerCode.isMind_2()>>wonderful <<endif>> description of discipline, leaving you squirming <<if playerCode.isMind_2()>>and dripping <<endif>> in your seat.
<<else>>\
	You patiently wait for the two women to finish their conversation, and soon, $guardian’s attention returns to you. @@.guardian;“I just can’t get over how magnificent you look,”@@ she says, beaming with praise. @@.guardian;“I’m stunned you went through all this for me. No wonder you were gone all day.”@@

	You smile back at her. @@.heroT;“Every second is worth it for someone as wonderful as you.”@@

	Now, $guardian’s face is a deep crimson.

	$teacher simply sits at the table politely, allowing the two of you to talk. Her only interruptions are to occasionally direct the waiter to bring the next course or refill your wine glasses. It is clear her role here is not to command the evening, but to facilitate this special night between you and $guardian.
<<endif>>\ 

As the three of you finish the dessert course, $guardian grabs your hand and leads you out onto the balcony. The stars sparkle overhead, as $guardian looks into your eyes and strokes your cheek. @@.guardian;“I know these past several weeks have been… intense,”@@ she says, @@.guardian;“but I can’t tell you how happy I am to be here with you tonight.”@@

Your heart thumps as $guardian smiles and gracefully descends to one knee, holding a ring box in her hand, snapping it open to reveal a glittering diamond ring.

@@.guardian;“$player.name, will you marry me?”@@

[[Yes!|Good Guardian Trophy Ending Sc5]]
