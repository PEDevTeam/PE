You tell $teacher that you want to marry Roxy. $teacher smiles. @@.teacher;“How interesting... She is quite the... rambunctious young lady, but I suppose you have come to enjoy that sort of thing. I will speak to her about arranging something special for the both of you this weekend.”@@

Your heart pounds as you consider the monumental decision you just made, but you cannot deny that the prospect of being Roxy’s trophy “wife” is exciting, and almost disturbingly arousing. $teacher raises an eyebrow as if to ask if you have anything else of her, and you hurry away.
