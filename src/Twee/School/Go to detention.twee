You go to the detention room. $teacher is waiting for you.

<<if $player.daringFlag.bribe>>\
	<<set $bribeAmount=50>>\
	<<set $player.bribeDiscount+=10*$time.weekDay()-10>>\
	<<set _nb = $bribeAmount-$player.bribeDiscount>>\
	<<set $player.perversion.teacher=1>>\

	@@.teacher;"Now, $player.name, I have given a lot of thought to what you tried earlier. I am insulted you think you could buy your way out of trouble with some pocket change. 
	
	"If money is what is important to you, then perhaps I can use it to teach you a lesson. If you wish to prevent me from reporting you to the principal, it will cost you $<<print $bribeAmount>> every Monday.\
	<<if $player.bribeDiscount gt 0>>\
		Since it's already <<print window.timeCode.weekDayText()>>, I will reduce this week's amount by $<<print $player.bribeDiscount>>, to $<<print _nb>>.@@

	@@.teacher;"This is non-negotiable. Your only other option here is for me tell the principal about your little bribe attempt. You'll be expelled, of course."@@

	You can't risk being expelled - she's got your balls and she knows it.
	@@.hero;Crap.@@

	@@.teacher;"I suspect you may have some trouble coming up with that much money every week, so I'll reduce it if you show some humility."@@  Sounds worrying...

	@@.teacher;"For every day you wear female underwear to school, I will take $<<print rewardMoney.teacherFemaleUnderwear>> off your week's payment."@@

	@@.hero;What? I have to wear panties to school? Is she serious?!@@
	
	You open your mouth to argue, but miffle out under $teacher's hard glare and just nod instead.

	Frustrated and embarrassed for chickening out you try to convince yourself that it's not a big deal. You just hope that noone would find out about it.
