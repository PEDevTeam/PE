	@@.nurse;"Sure! We have this serum we get from our supplier to make the effect semi-permanent, and it even has a counter-agent if you change your mind. It's really great! 

	"Except, um... there could be a //few// little side effects if you use it too long. But it's not //that// bad, really! Just be sure to come visit us from time to time for a check-up.
	
	"Also, there's a //teensy,// little chance the effects can go permanent. I wouldn't worry that much... but don't drag it out too long if you want to reverse it."@@

	@@.nurse;"So, this is one of our semi-permanent treatments. That means it won't wear off unless you use a counter-agent we get from our supplier. It's all super-complicated science stuff, but it's pretty cool not to have to worry about keeping it up for awhile, right?"
	
	"So, I'm supposed to tell you there's an //itty-bitty// chance the effects could go permanent, but it's super rare and usually only happens if they have time to set. It's probably going to be fine.

	Nancy smiles reassuringly, but she looks around before continuing. 

	"Just, um... if you change your mind, you know... //do it kinda soon."//@@

	@@.nurse;"So, this treatment is semi-permanent. That means you're all set if you like it, since you don't need to do any weekly treatments to keep up with it. It basically lasts for good, or until you change your mind and use the counter-agent we have that goes with it.

	"Personally, I love it because it's so hassle-free without all the commitment! Too bad dating isn't like that, right?"@@

	She lets out a bubbly little laugh.
	
	@@.nurse;"But, anyways, //legally,// I have to say that there //might// be some side effects if you use it for too long... but they're mostly no big deal and //super// rare. I would just come back for your normal weekly beauty consults here, and do a check up while you're stopping by!

	"Also... //sometimes-// not that often, though - there's a really tiny, pretty unlikely chance the treatments go permanent. It's usually only if you have 'em for a long time, or whatever.

	"If I was you, I would just, you know... come back sooner rather than later if you want to undo stuff."@@

	@@.nurse;"This treatment is semi-permanent. So, it won't require renewal and it's super simple to reverse it with a special procedure."@@
