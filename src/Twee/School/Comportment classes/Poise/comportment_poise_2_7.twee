	Maintaining your perfect posture and gait, you angle yourself to give $teacher the best view as you slowly bend over with your knees straight to pick up the pen. Rising back to full height you smile and return the pen to her desk.

	@@.hero;“It seems you dropped this ma’am”@@ you state softly as you lean forward and hold long enough to show off your cleavage as you place the pen back on her desk.

	She grins. @@.teacher;“Very good, my dear. You have successfully built on your previous lessons and mastered yet another dimension of proper feminine poise. I have one final class on this topic; but it will require you to do some legwork first. A proper lady must know how to dance, and not simply gyrating in a club, though we will address that too. You must show that you can handle yourself with grace, and learning how to properly dance is the most potent example. For that, you will need a partner. Please locate a suitable individual to assist you in this, then return to me together.”@@

	@@.hero;I wonder if one of my recent dates will help me out?  I should go out with them again and ask.@@
