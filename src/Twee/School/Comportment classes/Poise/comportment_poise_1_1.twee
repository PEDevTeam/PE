$teacher welcomes you into her classroom with a smile as she stands next to a chair that has been placed at the front of the room.

@@.teacher;“So, I have been observing you in class and... well, you have a lot of work to do if you are to ever pass as a proper, classy woman. The best way to learn is by doing, so I will be running you through a practice routine to test your ability to present yourself. Once you have managed to demonstrate these basics to a degree I find satisfactory, we will move on to future classes focused around other aspects of your general poise and demeanor. Now, take a seat.”@@
