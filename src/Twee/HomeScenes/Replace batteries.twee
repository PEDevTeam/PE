You find $guardian in the living room watching TV, and you offer to fix her alarm clock by replacing the batteries.  She gives you a smile and permission to go into her bedroom. 

@@.guardian;"Thanks, sweetie. That's very thoughtful of you."@@

You walk into $guardian's room, open the back of her alarm clock and replace the dead batteries with the fresh ones you bought.

This should stop her from sleeping in.
