		Nancy has you lay on some kind of special bed-chair you've never seen before.
		
		She hands you a pill, which you readily swallow, but instead of starting usual makeover, she just watches you with a weird smirk on her face.

		@@.nurse;"Sorry, honey. You've got quite a lot of money on your tab. Since you've gone over the limit, the terms of the agreement mean you're automatically enrolled in testing some of our latest treatments. But don't worry, we can put everything back to rights... once you've paid your tab, with interest of course. Personally, I think you're going to love the new you."@@

		You try to argue, but it's already a struggle even to sit up in the chair, the pill takes effect so quickly. Everything goes black...
