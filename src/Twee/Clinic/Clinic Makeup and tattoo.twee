		Pulling over a tray full of grooming accessories and a small case of makeup, Nancy starts working on your face.\
		<<if _previousMakeup lte 0>>\
			She begins by grooming your eyebrows a bit, tweaking their shape into more graceful arches. She then applies a tiny amount of lipstick and liner in shades similar to your natural lip color, adding evenness and a little shine but nothing drastic.

			She follows up with an assortment of puffs, palettes and brushes. While as far as you can tell, it feels like she's adding nothing with them, she concentrates closely as she does it.

			After some time, she steps back, her eyes darting back and forth over your facial features before she is satisfied.

			@@.nurse;"Finished!"@@, she announces. She spins you around in the chair to view the mirror.
			
			The changes are remarkably subtle, and at first glance, you can't really tell that you're even wearing makeup. As you look further, however, you see the the little details have definitely changed your face. Your features have been softened and lightly colored to make them more feminine, accentuating them in a natural-looking, understatedly beautiful way.
		<<else>>\
			She refreshes your makeup, cleaning your face where needed and then applying her familiar techniques again. She works carefully in some places and applies only quick touch-up passes in others. 

			Finally she stops, nodding approvingly and turning your chair to show you the mirror. Your makeup looks mostly the same as before, except maybe just a tiny bit brighter.

		Nancy invites you to sit in one of her cushy spa chairs, and then pulls over a rolling tray full of makeup and styling tools. She adds a small table on her opposite side with a few extra items, including some flesh-colored palettes, brushes, tubes of liners and lip colors, a half-dozen powder sifters, and other items you can't immediately identify except that they're obviously beauty products.

			You are shocked! You look so feminine, you hardly recognize yourself. While you know the actual shape of your face is still the same, its contours have been remarkably accentuated to bring out its beauty.
			
			You are especially surprised how the color applied to your eyes has softened them, and the shape of your cheekbones looks higher and more feminine. Even your lips look soft and kissable.

		Nancy has you sit in a spa chair, seeing that you're comfortable before pushing a medium-sized table covered with makeup and styling tools over by your side. A carousel of beauty products occupies the table's center, surrounded by a suite of grooming instruments and a large variety of colors, containers, sifters, brushes, puffs, sponges and other tools of the trade.
		
		@@.nurse;"This should be really fun,"@@ she beams. "You're gonna look great!"
		
		<<if _previousMakeup lte 2>>\
			Nancy looks at you with twinkling eyes as she begins to work. Her enthusiasm is clear as she studies your face carefully, deep in thought as she ponders her approach.

			She begins by eagerly threading your eyebrows, using the strands to pluck and trim them back into narrow, finely-cropped arches that have no remaining resemblance to their natural state. She then adds long, dark extensions to your eyelashes. She follows this by coating each eyelid with a colorful layer of mascara and eyeliner.

			Next, Nancy applies a thick, brightly contrasting lipstick. She uses a pencil and brush to distinguish their cupid-bowed border, and finishes the surface with a bright secondary coat that adds a level of shine.

			Finally, she pulls a tray over containing a small arsenal of makeup sponges, highlighting compacts, blush pallettes, powder puffs and more. For several minutes, she layers up the coloring over the entire rest of your face and even a little of your neck. She tirelessly conceals every last pore and patch of "problem skin," and your cheeks and bone structure are reworked by overt tricks of blush and color.

			With a last flourish of her powder brush, she finishes your look with prideful exhale. @@.nurse;"Finished!"@@, she beams. With visible anticipation, she spins your chair towards the mirror so you can witness your new look for yourself.
		
			You barely recognize the face in the mirror, a sight which freezes you in a speechless, awestruck state. In place of your familiar appearance, you see instead an overly-feminine one, highlighted with every sex-inspired fashion trick it can possibly bear.

			The look hovers near caricature, though due to Nancy's skill it narrowly avoids crossing that line. Your new face might not be out of place on a runway or fashion magazine cover, but it could just as easily fit in alongside photos of glamor-genre porn stars.
		<<else>>\
			Nancy carts out her armory of fashion accessories once more, and sets about renewing your makeup. The complexity of the look takes a careful hand in cleaning and prepping the faded areas, and she goes over your threaded eyebrows with no less effort than before, nipping out any tiny regrowth at the root. 
			
			Few areas escape extended attention, although a very few small places get only a touch-up. Nancy takes a proprietary interest in restoring her work on your face, though she is no less enthusiastic than when she first applied the look. She alters a few of her original choices for the sake of artistic variety, but her new selections are just as flamboyant as her old ones.
			
			Finally she finishes, nodding approvingly as she shows you the mirror. Your makeup has been restored to an all-new yet still-extreme level of glamorous fashion and sexual provocation.
		<<endif>>\
		
		@@.nurse;"I love your makeup, and I hope you do, too! I know you're wishing it could last forever, right? It's smudge- and water-resistant, but sadly, it's still only temporary - it'll only last about a week."
		
		You hear a sad note in her voice about that last point, but she quickly perks back up.
		
		"You look so fabulous, though! I'm sure I'll see you back here soon,"@@ Nancy comments with a coy smile.

		Nancy leads you over to a spa chair, and is doubly attentive in seeing to your complete comfort. She even gives you a special, heart-shaped pillow from her personal locker, tucking it under your head with a pat on your cheek.
		
		She disappears into the back room for a moment, returning with an imposing rolling makeup cabinet that's as tall as she is. She opens the doors, revealing myriad crammed drawers and mirror-backed panels, each overflowing with makeup containers and accessories beyond number and description.
		
		@@.nurse;"This is going to take me a little while, but it's going to be soooo worth it."@@ she says, her voice dripping with nearly sensual anticipation.
		
		<<if _previousMakeup lte 3>>\
			She begins by aggressively threading your eyebrows, cropping them away until all that is left are faint arches that are more lines than hair. Working with a fine-tipped brush, she restores the remnants to actual facial features using a dark, liquid-based color.
			
			Turning to your eyes themselves, she adds lengthy eyelash extensions, an entire color gradient of smoky eyeshadow, and a deep layer of mascara. It's only her first stage - she uses thin eyeliner applicators and pencils to bury any trace of natural shape and redefines the contours of your eyes into a cat-like point.

			Next, she applies lip color and liner. The multi-layered process is surprisingly complex, and you begin to lose track of how many different accessories she uses after the base layer of lipstick.
			
			Finally, she begins to work on your cheek and face. Nancy methodically covers ever corner of your skin from your hairline to the base of your neck with makeup. By the time she finishes, she's used so many makeup sponges, puffs, brushes and other tools that you think she might have confused your face with an oil painter's canvas.
			
			You lose track of how much time your makeover takes. Eventually, Nancy pushes back from your spa chair and looks you over. Her expression is one of an artist who has just completed her masterwork. 
			
			@@.nurse;"Finished!"@@, she gleefully announces. She spins you around in the chair to view the mirror, practically radiating her excitement.
		
			Your surprise at your reflection is real, all right, but not the kind you'd expected. After all that effort from Nancy, your face looks like it's been severely plastered in makeup - a cheap, trashy look that makes you look positively whorish. You're stunned, unable to form the words for a reaction.
		<<else>>\
			Nancy begins her painstaking efforts once again, though you still don't know why it takes so long for her to achieve the effect you came in with. Still, the long procession of tools and products continues for a long while, as Nancy gradually builds up a layer of makeup so complete, you can feel it sitting on your face.
			
			This weekend's restoration process is even more complicated than the last version, with certain areas having to be taken down to bare skin before Nancy is satisfied enough to start redoing them. You briefly wonder how she takes it all so seriously, but it's obvious this is her life's passion as she directs the utmost of her abilities at your face.

			Finally she stops, nodding approvingly and show you the mirror. Your whorish makeup looks as slutty as ever.

		Nancy sits you in the spa chair. She begins laying out and preparing the applicators, makeup colors, and other items she needs for the procedure, though disturbingly, some of them look more appropriate for a tattoo parlor than a beauty salon. She slides a tall rolling stool over to your side, and takes a seat on it.
		
		@@.nurse;"Now, this may hurt a little bit,"@@ she warns. @@.nurse;"Better take this pill to relax you, honey. You won't feel any pain once it kicks in."@@
		
		She hands you the pill and you gratefully swallow it. Meanwhile, Nancy begins mixing makeup pigments into a liquid base, and then filling the reservoir of her tattoo gun. The pill takes effect surprisingly quickly, and your focus blurs a little. As she poises the gun overhead and is placing her gloved fingers to the sides of your sensitive eyeballs, you space out completely, losing track of an unknown quantity of time.
		
		When you finally recover from most of the effects, Nancy has already finished.
		
		Once you return to full awareness, she spins the chair towards the mirror so you can see your new self. @@.nurse;"Ta-da!"@@ Nancy exclaims proudly.
		
		The changes are remarkably subtle. In fact, on first look, you can't even tell you've even been made up. As you begin to look further, however, you see the the little details have definitely changed your face. Your features have been softened and lightly colored to make them more feminine, accentuated them in a natural-looking, yet understated and beautiful way.

Shifting a work tray into place at your side, she begins taking out an assortment of applicators, makeup pigments and a variety of tools, some which are clearly taken from the tattoo trade and not the beauty profession. After briefly sorting and preparing everything, she scoots a tall, rolling stool over to you and has a seat.

Not much time elapses before you feel the pill's effects, and you catch a brief glimpse of her lifting her tattoo gun before your attention goes blank.
		
		You blink your eyes, returning from the daze, and wonder how much time has gone by. Nancy has already put her tray of tools away, and is waiting quietly to show you your new look. As you fully recover, she spins your chair so you can see.
		
		"What do you think?" she asks.

		You're amazed to see the face of a beautifully made up woman. It takes you a second to realize that is //your// face.
		
		While you know the actual shape of your face is still the same, its contours have been skillfully highlighted to accentuate its beauty. You are especially surprised how the shading around your eyes has softened them, and the shape of your cheekbones looks higher and more feminine. Even your lips look soft and kissable.

		In place of your familiar appearance, you see an overly-feminine one, graced with every sex-inspired beauty trick it can possibly bear. The look hugs the line between high fashion and caricature, though due to Nancy's skill it just manages to avoid crossing it. Your new face might not be out of place on a runway or glamor magazine, but it would be a better fit among racier erotic photo sets.

		You can't believe how vulgar and slutty your face looks, each and every time you see yourself in a mirror. Especially the way all the little details like smudges, cracks, slightly uneven lines give you cheap and easy look. As you study your new face longer, you realize that its all deliberate and serves purpose to give you very erotic, but at the same time dehumanizing appearance.
		
		It would be very hard to be taken seriously with a face of a sex doll, focused on inducing the lowest desires in men and maybe even women.
		
		@@.reward;You now have a permanently made-up, trashy, whorish look!@@

	@@.nurse;"We'll need a bit of privacy for this one,"@@ she says, beckoning you to follow.

	Nancy leads you to the back room of the salon, and has you remove your clothes. She helps you lean forward onto the purposely-reclined spa chair with your back to her, and sees to it you're as comfortable as possible.
	
	@@.nurse;"Now, this one hurts a bit more than usual, because that placement is a pretty sensitive spot,"@@ she cautions. @@.nurse;"Better take this pill. It'll take a lot of the sting off, and you won't care about the pain that much, anyway."@@
	
	She hands you the little pill. You gratefully swallow it down while she puts on some clear plastic gloves and gets her tattoo gun ready.
	
	You start to feel fuzzy fairly quickly, and your last clear memory is the arrival of contented bliss. While you vaguely notice her working, you soon lose track and fall into a //very// copacetic state of mind.
	
	You don't think you fell asleep, but it's not for several minutes after she finishes that you even realize she's done. She holds out her hand to help you up.

	Bringing you to the salon vanity, Nancy passes you a hand mirror so you can more easily see your new addition. Using it in combination with the giant mirror on the wall, you see your flowery tramp stamp in all its glory. In beautiful, black letter calligraphy, a design prominently featuring the words, 'Stupid Whore' has been emblazoned onto the small of your back.
	
	@@.nurse;"Hey, the classics never get old! Am I right?"@@ Nancy gazes proudly at her work.
