::Cheer Ep7 Sc5
<<set playerCode.loadQuickSlot(quickSlotSets.Casual)>>\
You make your way home, thinking over the events at practice today, still unsure if you’re going to stay with the squad. You enter the house, dump your bookbag on the table, and run up to your room, changing into a set of casual clothes before heading back downstairs to grab a drink from the fridge.

You get to the bottom of the stairs and freeze, seeing $guardian standing over your bag and reading over the cheerleading release form.

	@@.guardian;“What’s this?”@@ $guardian asks quizzically as she notices you.

	@@.heroT;“It’s a.. uh… form I need you to sign,”@@ you admit, @@.heroT;“for some after school activities.”@@

	@@.guardian;“It says it’s for a cheerleading competition.”@@

	Sweat is starting to bead on your face.

	@@.heroT;“I’ve.. um… been helping out with the cheerleading squad, just like, helping out with equipment and stuff.”@@

	It’s not exactly a lie, but your timid tone does little to hide that you’re holding some facts back.

		@@.heroT;“No!”@@ you say, but you’re too late to stop her from pulling out the uniform you stole.

		@@.guardian;“Wait, is this my old uniform?”@@ $guardian asks as she checks the tag. @@.guardian;“It is! How on earth did you get this?”@@

		@@.heroT;“I, uh, found it in the equipment room,”@@ you admit.

		@@.guardian;“I wonder if it still fits,”@@ $guardian muses before disappearing into her room. She reappears moments later, clad in the red and white cheerleading outfit.

		@@.guardian;“Well, what do you think?”@@ she asks, giving you a twirl.

		Your breath catches when you look at her. Though the long-sleeved white sweater and knee-length red skirt is considerably more modest than the school’s current cheerleading uniforms, the top hugs $guardian’s full breasts tightly and the skirt swishes in just the right way to reveal her shapely legs. Your cock aches as drips of precum fall from your cage.

		@@.heroT;“You look great.”@@

		She smiles. @@.guardian;“Thanks.@@\

			Your heart stops. “Huh?”

			She laughs. @@.guardian;“I know the cheer team is girl only, I was on it remember, and I know you’ve been wearing girl’s clothes.”@@ She smirks. @@.guardian;“You just joined the squad for the cute outfit, didn’t you?”@@

			You start to object, but she cuts you off. @@.guardian;“If you want me to sign that form, I want to see you dress up and do a cheer for me. Got it?”@@

			You gulp. Seems like you’re not getting out of this one so easily.

			You take the paper and snap up your bag, ensuring she can’t find anything else incriminating in it, before running back up to your room.
