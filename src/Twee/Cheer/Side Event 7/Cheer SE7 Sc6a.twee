You sit next to her on the bench, staying quiet as you don’t know what to say. $cheerFriend.name notices you and latches onto you, crying into your shoulder. You wrap your arms around her, letting her cry herself out.

When her tears finally stop, $cheerFriend.name looks up at you with a sniffle. @@.cheerFriend;“Thanks,”@@ she says with a weak smile. She looks down at your uniform, now stained with her makeup. @@.cheerFriend;“I think I messed up your outfit.”@@

You laugh. @@.heroT;“That… I’m sure it’ll wash out,”@@ you tell her.

She sighs. @@.cheerFriend;“Guess I ruined a bunch of people’s night, huh?”@@

You shake your head. @@.heroT;“They’ll deal with it.”@@

$cheerFriend.name sighs again. @@.cheerFriend;“Sorry. I… I can’t stand things like this. I know my mom knew a ton of people and everything, but everyone in there is basically a stranger to me. Anytime I get dragged along to one of these band things, it sucks. All anyone ever does is tell me how much like my mom I am. It’s like all they see when they look at me is her.”@@

She rests her head back on your chest. @@.cheerFriend;“As much as I love my mom, I… I hate that she isn’t here anymore, and when everyone tells me I’m just like her, I can’t help but think about how she left me behind. I don’t want to do that to anyone like she did.”@@

$cheerFriend.name’s father’s voice comes from behind you. @@.malevoice10;“Oh, honey,” he says as he sits on the other end of the bench from you. “Listen, your mom made a lot of mistakes, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll do the same.”@@ He takes $cheerFriend.name’s hand. @@.malevoice10;“You two are similar in a lot of ways, ways those people will never understand, but what really makes you special is all the ways you're different from her. Heck, $cheerleaders.fakeName never even met your mom, and she thinks you’re pretty awesome, right?”@@

@@.heroT;“Definitely,”@@ you say, earning another smile from $cheerFriend.name.

@@.malevoice10;“Listen, $cheerFriend.name, All your mom and I ever wanted for you is to be better and happier than we were, and I know she would be so proud of you if she could see you now, because you’re everything that made her great, but different in so many that make you wonderful all on your own.”@@

$cheerFriend.name hugs her father tightly and says, @@.heroT;“Thanks, Dad.”@@ After breaking her embrace, she turns back to you. @@.cheerFriend;“Uh, Dad, do you think $cheerleaders.fakeName and I could go home early?”@@

@@.malevoice10;“Sure,”@@ he says as he passes her the keys to the family car. @@.malevoice10;“Don’t worry. I’ll cover for you and find a ride back home when everything is done. You going to be ok?”@@

$cheerFriend.name smiles back at you. @@.cheerFriend;“Yeah. I think so,”@@ she says.
