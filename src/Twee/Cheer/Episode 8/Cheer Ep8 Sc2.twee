::Cheer Ep8 Sc2
Almost the entire rest of the squad has crammed themselves into the large van provided by the school for transportation. You climb in, seeing $cheerFriend.name, now wearing her new cheer dress, waving for you to sit by her. The red and white cheer dress suits $cheerFriend.name perfectly, and you can’t help but feel your cock stiffening as you admire her in it.

Moving a bit awkwardly because of your compressed erection, you take the seat next to $cheerFriend.name.

@@.cheerFriend;“What took you so long?”@@ $cheerFriend.name asks as you scoot onto the bench.

@@.cheerCaptain;“Couldn’t find the van,”@@ Rachel interrupts as she climbs into the passenger’s seat. @@.friend;“But we’re all good to go now. Right, $cheerleaders.fakeName?”@@

@@.heroT;“Umm, yeah,”@@ you reply.

The driver side door opens, and $teacher, looking like a gym teacher in a tight-fitting white polo, gym shorts, and sneakers climbs into the driver’s seat.

@@.hero;Oh shit…@@

@@.teacher;“You girls ready for a fun trip?”@@ $teacher asks, thankfully not making a point to call out your presence.

The girls all shout “Yeah!” in unison, and $teacher starts the van and drives off.

During the ride, you mostly sit in silence as the girls chatter around you, terrified that $teacher will bring up your true nature to the other girls. Instead, she seems content to simply chat with Rachel about the upcoming competition.

Oddly enough, Ashley seems to be missing from the squad members in the van, and you wonder if Rachel banned her from coming as punishment for what happened in the locker room.

After a lengthy drive, the bus finally comes to a stop in the parking lot of the fun park. The girls clamber out of the car, stretching to get the blood flowing back in their legs.

The group moves towards a building marked “Lobby and Arcade” when you hear $teacher call, @@.teacher;“$cheerleaders.fakeName, can I see you for a moment?”@@

You turn to $teacher, the look on her face making it clear her request is not to be ignored.

@@.cheerFriend;“You in trouble or something?”@@ Lauren asks.

@@.heroT;“I don’t think so…”@@ you say with trepidation. @@.heroT;“Go ahead inside. I’ll be there in a second.”@@

You walk over to $teacher. @@.teacher;“She’s cute,”@@ $teacher says with a sly smile as the cheerleaders disappear inside. @@.teacher;“Glad to see you getting along with the other cheerleaders.”@@

@@.heroT;“I… I guess”@@ you reply.

@@.teacher;“Rachel told me about your disappointment at not making the cheerleading squad with your friend. Were you finally starting to like being a girl?”@@

@@.heroT;“That’s… that’s not…”@@

@@.teacher;“I think it’s good that you’re finding somewhere to explore your femininity on your own, and at least one of the girls on the squad seems like she’d be disappointed if you gave it up for some pointless reason.”@@

You instantly know that, like always, she’s seen right through you. 

@@.teacher;“Well, just wanted to have a little chat. I’m not here to take over your day of fun.”@@ She smiles. @@.teacher;“Not unless you want me to.”@@ You shake your head. @@.teacher;“I thought so. Why don’t you head on inside?”@@

As you are about to walk away, you hear a familiar voice yelling further down the parking lot. You turn to see Ashley getting out of a luxury sedan, clearly arguing with the woman driving it.

@@.cheerBitch;“I told you we were going to be late!”@@ Ashley complains.

@@.femvoice10;“Don’t you raise your voice at me young lady,”@@ the woman sternly reprimands. @@.femvoice10;“As a member of this family you have responsibilities to uphold, and I expect you to do so.”@@

@@.cheerBitch;“Stop trying to control my life! I have better things to do than go to your stupid high society bullshit, you know, like cheerleading, which I’m late for.”@@

@@.femvoice10;“Well maybe if you had been dedicated enough to make captain like I was, I’d have a little more respect for your cheerleading.”@@

@@.cheerBitch;“Oh my God, Mom! I told you, I didn’t want to be captain. Rachel’s much better at all the paperwork and team spirit shit.”@@

@@.femvoice10;“And that lack of ambition is why you’ll never amount to anything. If you’re not going to make something of yourself, then all your good for is being married off. It’s the least you can do after all the money and effort your father and I have put into you. That’s why I’m sending you to those classes. So, just maybe, some rich playboy will think you’re a decent fuck.”@@

Ashley screams in frustration as she slams the car door.

You glance over at $teacher, who seems to be looking at you with expectation. You remember her suggestion to try making friends with Ashley, and wonder if she’s silently trying to remind you of it. Of course, it’s clear from the rage-filled look on Ashley’s face that she is in no mood for conversation.

	@@.hero;I mean, I guess I could see if she’s ok… or just head inside, if I want to keep my face from being ripped off.@@

	[[Go talk to Ashley|Cheer Ep8 Sc3]]
<<else>>\
	@@.hero;There’s no way anything I say is going to make her feel better. I should head inside before she rips my face off.@@
