You grab $cheerFriend.name and lead her over to the floral top and skirt set. @@.heroT;“I want you to try this on,”@@ you say before handing her a box containing the matching wedge sandals, @@.heroT;“and these.”@@

She looks at the items excitedly. @@.cheerFriend;“Ooh! These are cute!”@@

@@.heroT;“Yeah, but I think you’ll look great in it,”@@ you assure her.

@@.cheerFriend;“Great,”@@ she says, @@.cheerFriend;“and I found this for you.”@@ She reveals a tight-fitting hot pink minidress with ruffles across the straps and hem and a sash tied into a loose bow. @@.cheerFriend;“And funnily enough, I grabbed these,”@@ she adds motioning towards the box in her hand, which you open to reveal a set of wite wedges, these with a little less of an aggressive heel than the ones you picked out for her. @@.cheerFriend;“Wanna go try ‘em on?”@@

You and $cheerFriend.name head towards the dressing room.\
<<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=15>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Oh hush,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Like I don’t change in front of girls every week at practice.”@@

	Without warning, $cheerFriend.name strips off her dress, leaving her standing in front of you in just a black t-shirt bra and thong panties. Even dressed in such simple lingerie, the sight causes your breath to hitch and your cock to stiffen<<if _chastity>> in its cage<<endif>>.

	You spin around, trying to protect your modesty as you carefully remove your clothes. You can hear $cheerFriend.name giggling at your embarrassment, but it seems she fails to notice any of your… unique features before you can pull your dress on.

	As you turn back around, you see $cheerFriend.name is still pulling her outfiton, her barely-covered ass is on full display, and you can feel your cock ache at the sight.

	$cheerFriend.name pulls the skirt up, slips on the sandals, and turns to face you. @@.cheerFriend;“Like what you see?”@@ she asks, giving you a cute pose.

<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Look, all the other ones were full,”@@ she explains. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t mind sharing, just you know, make sure you’re facing the other direction when I change.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh, ok…”@@ you say, turning to face the wall as you both pull your clothes off. You are tempted to glance back over your shoulder, but the fear of being caught ogling $cheerFriend.name wins out, and you dutifully keep your gaze forward as you dress. 

	Finally, $cheerFriend.name asks, @@.cheerFriend;“You good?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah”@@ you reply, smoothing out your skirt as you both spin around.

<<else>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then disappears into the next dressing room. Just knowing $cheerFriend.name is changing only a few feet over makes your cock stiffen, and you are grateful she isn’t here to see your clothes tenting.

	You pull the dress on, and slip on the sandals before walking back out of the booth. $cheerFriend.name is already waiting for you, standing in front of a triple mirror. @@.cheerFriend;“Well?”@@ she asks, giving you a twirl. @@.cheerFriend;“What do you think?”@@

<<endif>>\
The outfit is even more stunning on her than you could have imagined, quintessentially $cheerFriend.name, yet more daring than her usual looks. The top’s tie-front creates a deep, plunging neckline and the skirt hugs her ass perfectly, while still swishing back and forth along her hemline. The white wedges definitely give her a bit of height and add a dash of needed edge to the ensemble. $cheerFriend.name radiates soft, feminine beauty.

@@.heroT;“Wow”@@ is the only word you can manage to get out of your mouth.

@@.cheerFriend;“I love it,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says with a grin. @@.cheerFriend;“It’s so light and airy!”@@ She giggles as she runs her fingers across the exposed skin of her chest, raising goose pimples.

@@.cheerFriend;“Now let’s do you,”@@ she says, stepping back from the mirror so you can take her place. @@.cheerFriend;“Spin around for me, so I can see what it looks like from all sides.”@@

You do as ordered, feeling $cheerFriend.name’s eyes carefully appraising you.

@@.cheerFriend;“You look so adorable!”@@ she squeals. @@.cheerFriend;“Might need a couple of extra accessories to really finish the look, but <<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>girly stuff really suits you<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=5>>I think you look great<<else>>you’ll totally pick up some guys at the concert looking that<<endif>>.”@@

You blush at the compliment, and she smiles.

@@.cheerFriend;“Tell you what, let’s go get undressed. I’ll spring for both of these, and we can wear them to the concert together.”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Thanks,”@@ you say, returning her smile.
