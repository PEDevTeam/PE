You grab $cheerFriend.name and lead her over to the black and pink vinyl dress. @@.heroT;“I want you to try this on,”@@ you say before handing her a box containing the matching boots, @@.heroT;“and these.”@@

She raises an eyebrow as she looks over the items. @@.cheerFriend;“Aren’t latex outfits for like dommes and stuff?”@@

@@.heroT;“Yeah, but I think you’ll look great in it,”@@ you assure her.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok,”@@ she relents, @@.cheerFriend;“but you have to wear…”@@ She begins looking over the nearby dresses. @@.cheerFriend;“...this!”@@ $cheerFriend.name grabs a shiny, pink minidress with long sleeves and a waist-line slit designed to make the dress look like two pieces. @@.cheerFriend;“And I think these boots would look cute with it,”@@ she adds motioning towards the box in her hand. @@.cheerFriend;“Why don’t you grab a pair?”@@

Once you have grabbed the clothes, you and $cheerFriend.name head towards the dressing room.\
<<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=15>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Oh hush,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Like I don’t change in front of girls every week at practice.”@@

	Without warning, $cheerFriend.name strips off her dress, leaving her standing in front of you in just a black t-shirt bra and thong panties. Even dressed in such simple lingerie, the sight causes your breath to hitch and your cock to stiffen<<if _chastity>> in its cage<<endif>>.

	You spin around, trying to protect your modesty as you carefully remove your clothes. You can hear $cheerFriend.name giggling at your embarrassment, but it seems she fails to notice any of your… unique features before you can pull your dress on.

	As you turn back around, you see $cheerFriend.name is still pulling her dress on, her barely-covered ass is on full display, and you can feel your cock ache at the sight.

	$cheerFriend.name pulls the dress down, slips on the boots, and turns to face you. @@.cheerFriend;“Like what you see?”@@ she asks, giving you a cute pose.

<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Look, all the other ones were full,”@@ she explains. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t mind sharing, just you know, make sure you’re facing the other direction when I change.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh, ok…”@@ you say, turning to face the wall as you both pull your clothes off. You are tempted to glance back over your shoulder, but the fear of being caught ogling $cheerFriend.name wins out, and you dutifully keep your gaze forward as you dress. 

	Finally, $cheerFriend.name asks, @@.cheerFriend;“You good?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah”@@ you reply, smoothing out your skirt as you both spin around.

<<else>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then disappears into the next dressing room. Just knowing $cheerFriend.name is changing only a few feet over makes your cock stiffen, and you are grateful she isn’t here to see your clothes tenting.

	You pull the dress on, and slip on the boots before walking back out of the booth. $cheerFriend.name is already waiting for you, standing in front of a triple mirror. @@.cheerFriend;“Well, let’s get this over with,”@@ she says.

<<endif>>\
The outfit is even more stunning on her than you could have imagined. The vinyl dress clings attractively to the curve, with its low bustline tantalizingly presenting her cleavage and the high skirt and knee-length boots showing off her shapely, toned legs. <<if $cheerFriend.affinity < 5>>The fetishy outfit gives her an uncharacteristic air of command and confidence, one you’re unused to seeing on the usually easy-going $cheerFriend.name.<<else>>That said, $cheerFriend.name definitely doesn’t give off your typical domme air, even as the fetishy outfit seems to suit her.<<endif>>

@@.heroT;“Wow”@@ is the only word you can manage to get out of your mouth.

@@.cheerFriend;“It’s kinda weird,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, pulling on the skirt as if she’s trying to will it to be less revealing. @@.cheerFriend;“How do people wear this kind of stuff?”@@ She gives up with a sigh and turns her attention your way.

@@.cheerFriend;“Now let’s do you,”@@ she says, stepping back from the mirror so you can take her place. @@.cheerFriend;“Spin around for me, so I can see what it looks like from all sides.”@@

You do as ordered, feeling $cheerFriend.name’s eyes carefully appraising you.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok. I think this kind of stuff looks way better on you than me,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Might need a couple of extra accessories to really finish the look, but <<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>I’m definitely seeing the appeal<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=5>>I think you look great<<else>>you’ll totally pick up some guys at the concert looking that<<endif>>.”@@

You blush at the compliment, and she smiles.

@@.cheerFriend;“Tell you what, let’s go get undressed. I don’t think I’m going to get this one, but if you want, I’ll buy you yours for being a good sport and you can wear it to the concert.”@@

@@.heroT;“Thanks,”@@ you say.
