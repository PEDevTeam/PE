You grab $cheerFriend.name and lead her over to the barely-there pink dress. @@.heroT;“I want you to try this on,”@@ you say before handing her a box containing the matching white heels, @@.heroT;“and these.”@@

She raises an eyebrow as she looks over the items. @@.cheerFriend;“Very funny. Where’s the rest of it?”@@

@@.heroT;“C’mon. You said you’d wear whatever I picked out,”@@ you remind her.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok,”@@ she relents, @@.cheerFriend;“but you have to wear…”@@ She begins looking over the nearby dresses. “...this!” $cheerFriend.name grabs a hot pink minidress with a halter top, large side cutouts, and bows attached to cords that crisscross along the back. @@.cheerFriend;“Ooh and these heels would go perfect,”@@ she adds, reaching for a pair of metallic, strappy stilettos. @@.cheerFriend;“Ready?”@@

Once you have grabbed the clothes, you and $cheerFriend.name head towards the dressing room.\

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Oh hush,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Like I don’t change in front of girls every week at practice.”@@

	Without warning, $cheerFriend.name strips off her dress, leaving her standing in front of you in just a black t-shirt bra and thong panties. Even dressed in such simple lingerie, the sight causes your breath to hitch and your cock to stiffen<<if _chastity>> in its cage<<endif>>.

	You spin around, trying to protect your modesty as you carefully remove your clothes. You can hear $cheerFriend.name giggling at your embarrassment, but it seems she fails to notice any of your… unique features before you can pull your dress on.

	As you turn back around, you see $cheerFriend.name is still pulling her dress on, her barely-covered ass is on full display, and you can feel your cock ache at the sight.

	$cheerFriend.name pulls the dress down, slips on the heels, and turns to face you. @@.cheerFriend;“Like what you see?”@@ she asks, giving you a cute pose.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Look, all the other ones were full,”@@ she explains. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t mind sharing, just you know, make sure you’re facing the other direction when I change.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh, ok…”@@ you say, turning to face the wall as you both pull your clothes off. You are tempted to glance back over your shoulder, but the fear of being caught ogling $cheerFriend.name wins out, and you dutifully keep your gaze forward as you dress. 

	Finally, $cheerFriend.name asks, @@.cheerFriend;“You good?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah”@@ you reply, smoothing out your skirt as you both spin around.

<<else>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then disappears into the next dressing room. Just knowing $cheerFriend.name is changing only a few feet over makes your cock stiffen, and you are grateful she isn’t here to see your clothes tenting.

	You pull the dress on, and lace up the heels before walking back out of the booth. $cheerFriend.name is already waiting for you, standing in front of a triple mirror. @@.cheerFriend;“Well, let’s get this over with,”@@ she says.

The outfit is even more stunning on her than you could have imagined. The dress cutouts showing off her cleavage and ample amounts of smooth skin, while the high hemline exhibits nearly every inch of her shapely dancer’s legs. The white, block heeled sandals are the perfect accompaniment, giving $cheerFriend.name a rare visage of pure sex appeal.

@@.heroT;“Wow”@@ is the only word you can manage to get out of your mouth.

@@.cheerFriend;“I feel like such a slut,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, half covering herself with her arms. @@.cheerFriend;“How do people wear this kind of stuff?”@@ She gives up with a sigh and turns her attention your way.

@@.cheerFriend;“Now let’s do you,”@@ she says, stepping back from the mirror so you can take her place. @@.cheerFriend;“Spin around for me, so I can see what it looks like from all sides.”@@

You do as ordered, feeling $cheerFriend.name’s eyes carefully appraising you.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok. I think this kind of stuff looks way better on you than me,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Might need a couple of extra accessories to really finish the look, but <<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>I’m definitely seeing the appeal<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=5>>I think you look great<<else>>you’ll totally pick up some guys at the concert looking that<<endif>>.”@@

You blush at the compliment, and she smiles.

@@.cheerFriend;“Tell you what, let’s go get undressed. I don’t think I’m going to get this one, but if you want, I’ll buy you yours for being a good sport and you can wear it to the concert.”@@

<<if playerCode.isMind(true) == 2>>\
	Your mouth almost acting on its own, you blurt out, @@.heroT;“Yeah, I want it.”@@

	$cheerFriend.name looks amused and lets out a quiet laugh. @@.cheerFriend;“All right. Let’s go get changed, and I’ll check out.”@@

	@@.heroT;“I, uh, I think I’m good,”@@ you say, feeling a bit uncomfortable as your pulse races from seeing the slut staring back at you in the mirror.
