You grab $cheerFriend.name and lead her over to the lolita-inspired schoolgirl outfit. @@.heroT;“I want you to try this on,”@@ you say before handing her a box containing the matching shoes, @@.heroT;“and these.”@@

She raises an eyebrow as she looks over the items. @@.cheerFriend;“I mean, I guess they’re kinda cute? Maybe a little too… anime con for me.”@@

@@.heroT;“Yeah, but I think you’ll look great in it,”@@ you assure her.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok,”@@ she relents, @@.cheerFriend;“but you have to wear…”@@ She begins looking over the nearby dresses, a devious spark in her eye. @@.cheerFriend;“...this!”@@ $cheerFriend.name grabs a floofy pink dress covered in bows with puffy cap sleeves and a built-in white petticoat under the surprisingly short skirt. @@.cheerFriend;“Ooh! And these!”@@ She grabs a pair of chunky pink boots nearby with an included pair of fuzzy anklecuffs connected by a short chain and covered in heart studs.

@@.heroT;“Really?”@@ you ask, shocked by her daring selection.

@@.cheerFriend;“If you’re gonna make me wear a costume, I’m gonna do the same to you,”@@ she says with a laugh.

Once you have grabbed the clothes, you and $cheerFriend.name head towards the dressing room.\
<<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=15>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Oh hush,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Like I don’t change in front of girls every week at practice.”@@

	<<if not _bra || not _underwear>>\

	Without warning, $cheerFriend.name strips off her dress, leaving her standing in front of you in just a black t-shirt bra and thong panties. Even dressed in such simple lingerie, the sight causes your breath to hitch and your cock to stiffen<<if _chastity>> in its cage<<endif>>.

	You spin around, trying to protect your modesty as you carefully remove your clothes. You can hear $cheerFriend.name giggling at your embarrassment, but it seems she fails to notice any of your… unique features before you can pull your dress on.

	As you turn back around, you see $cheerFriend.name is still pulling her dress on, her barely-covered ass is on full display, and you can feel your cock ache at the sight.

	$cheerFriend.name pulls the dress down, slips on the shoes, and turns to face you. @@.cheerFriend;“Like what you see?”@@ she asks, giving you a cute pose.

<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then, surprisingly, walks in with you.

	@@.heroT;“What?”@@ you ask, clearly flustered.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Look, all the other ones were full,”@@ she explains. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t mind sharing, just you know, make sure you’re facing the other direction when I change.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh, ok…”@@ you say, turning to face the wall as you both pull your clothes off. You are tempted to glance back over your shoulder, but the fear of being caught ogling $cheerFriend.name wins out, and you dutifully keep your gaze forward as you dress. 

	Finally, $cheerFriend.name asks, @@.cheerFriend;“You good?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah”@@ you reply, smoothing out your skirt as you both spin around.

<<else>>\
	$cheerFriend.name opens the door to one of the booths for you to enter, and then disappears into the next dressing room. Just knowing $cheerFriend.name is changing only a few feet over makes your cock stiffen, and you are grateful she isn’t here to see your clothes tenting.

	You pull the dress on, and slip on the boots before walking back out of the booth. $cheerFriend.name is already waiting for you, standing in front of a triple mirror. @@.cheerFriend;“Well?”@@ she asks, giving you a twirl. @@.cheerFriend;“What do you think?”@@

<<endif>>\
The outfit is even more stunning on her than you could have imagined. Any latent schoolgirl fantasy you held is immediately brought to the surface as $cheerFriend.name twirls back and forth, causing the hem of her skirt to raise tantalizingly high. The black shoes provide a dark contrast against the muted pink, while the bow accents only serve to emphasize the kawaii aesthetic. 

@@.heroT;“Wow”@@ is the only word you can manage to get out of your mouth.

@@.cheerFriend;“It’s kinda weird,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, as she considers herself in the mirror. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t hate it, but I don’t really like it either. Though, I guess wearing it one night won’t kill me.”@@ She gives up with a sigh and turns her attention your way.

@@.cheerFriend;“Now let’s do you,”@@ she says, stepping back from the mirror so you can take her place. @@.cheerFriend;“Spin around for me, so I can see what it looks like from all sides.”@@

You do as ordered, feeling $cheerFriend.name’s eyes carefully appraising you.

@@.cheerFriend;“Ok. I think this kind of stuff looks way better on you than me,”@@ she says. @@.cheerFriend;“Might need a couple of extra accessories to really finish the look, but <<if $cheerFriend.affinity >=10>>you look just adorable in that frilly outfit<<elseif $cheerFriend.affinity >=5>>I think you look great<<else>>you’ll totally pick up some guys at the concert looking that<<endif>>.”@@

You blush at the compliment, and she smiles.

@@.cheerFriend;“Tell you what, let’s go get undressed. I’ll spring for both of these, and we can wear them to the concert together.”@@

@@.heroT;“Thanks,”@@ you say, returning her smile..
