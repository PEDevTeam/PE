		Attempting to appear focused on supporting $cheerFriend.name, you let your eyes move up along your fellow cheerleader’s shapely legs, diving beneath her skirt to find the unmistakable flash of red of the squad’s cheer bloomers. The thick undergarments cling tightly to $cheerFriend.name’s pert backside, and as you admire the shape of her ass, you feel the bite of your cock cage. 

		The sudden discomfort causes you to jerk, destabilizing the tower of bodies, and forcing $cheerFriend.name to jump to the ground to avoid falling.

		@@.cheerCaptain;“$cheerleaders.fakeName! Keep your eyes forward,”@@ Rachel shouts.

		@@.cheerBitch;“Busted,”@@ Ashley says with a chuckle, while $cheerFriend.name’s cheeks turn red once she realizes what you were up to.

		@@.hero;Damn it… I really should have known better than to try that.@@

		Before you have time to dwell your mistake, Rachel is already having you set up for another attempt at the stunt.
	<<else>>\
		You keep your eyes forward, focusing on performing the stunt and keeping $cheerFriend.name from falling. $cheerFriend.name strikes a high V pose and, with Rachel’s guidance, you and Ashley help her dismount.

		@@.heroT;“Cut it out!”@@ you snip as you squirm away from Ashley’s hand. The sudden shift causes you to lose your balance, and you have to leap from your perch on Ashley’s and $cheerFriend.name’s legs to avoid falling to the ground. Ashley glares at you, but before she can say anything, Rachel cuts in, ordering the three of you to repeat the stunt.

		Ashley scoffs, and as you move back into position. $cheerFriend.name pulls you in and whispers, @@.cheerFriend;“Nice. If you don’t fight back, she’ll never stop messing with you.”@@
	<<else>>\
		Very carefully, you rock your hips back, driving <<if window.wardrobeFuncs.getWornItem('buttplug')>>your buttplug deeper<<else>>Ashley’s finger<<endif>> into your ass. Sensing your submission, Ashley smiles, wriggling her fingers in a way that makes you gasp as <<if window.wardrobeFuncs.getWornItem('buttplug')>>your plug tickles your prostate<<else>>her fingers squirm inside you<<endif>>.

		You start to lose yourself to the sensations, and feel your center of balance slipping, causing you to stumble forward off Ashley and $cheerFriend.name’s legs.

		Rachel shakes her head, and you are unsure if she’s exasperated at Ashley’s antics or your inability to stay in position. @@.cheerCaptain;“All right. Let’s try it again,”@@ Rachel orders.

It is clear that Rachel is very intent on having you learn this stunt backwards and forwards, as your repetitions of the thigh stand far outnumber the other two stunts. By the time Rachel finally allows you to rest, your arms and thigh are surprisingly sore.

@@.cheerCaptain;“Well, that’s a wrap,”@@ Rachel says, looking at the time on her watch. @@.cheerCaptain;“You guys did good today. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll manage to get you two competition ready by the semi-finals. Keep working at home, and I’ll see you at next practice.”@@

The other girls head off to the locker room, and you go to find a bench to wait until they finish to go collect your things from the gym. You survey the practice field and notice a trio of unfamiliar girls gathered on the far side of the field. While they are wearing coats, their matching blue and white skirts make it clear they are not Pepperton students.

Are those the cheerleaders from the competition?
