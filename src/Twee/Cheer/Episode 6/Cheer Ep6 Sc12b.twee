::Cheer Ep6 Sc12b
@@.heroT;“Fuck off, Ashley,”@@ you say, trying to push past her again.

@@.cheerBitch;“Well, I tried asking nicely,”@@ Ashley says with a shrug as you manage to step around her. She pulls out her phone and presses a few buttons. Suddenly, the unmistakable sound of you performing Ashley’s cheer routine loudly emanates from the phone. 

@@.cheerBitch;“You’d think someone would know better than to say ‘no’ to someone who has video of him doing some rather scandalous things in the school theater.”@@

You stop dead in your tracks and turn to face Ashley, white as a sheet. @@.heroT;“You… You wouldn’t.”@@

@@.cheerBitch;“I dunno,”@@ she says, drawing out the final vowel in mock uncertainty. @@.cheerBitch;“I think the AV club would have a fun time distributing the video all over school.”@@

@@.heroT;“C’mon,”@@ you plead, @@.heroT;“you wouldn’t do that, would you. My life would be over.”@@

@@.cheerBitch;“All I ask is you try to be a little more agreeable when I ask you to do something.”@@

@@.heroT;“Ok. Ok. Just… don’t show anyone what happened yesterday. Well, anyone else.”@@

She stops the video and slides the phone back in her pocket. @@.cheerBitch;“Good sissy. I want you to meet us at the gym before school on Monday, and don’t forget to wear your uniform. Got it?”@@

You nod dejectedly.

@@.cheerBitch;“And don’t even think of trying to bail on us. Otherwise, you might just see yourself on the morning announcements. Understand?”@@

Ashley reinforces her threat with a sharp poke to your sternum, making you wince. Having gotten the reaction she wanted from you, her scowl evaporates.

@@.cheerBitch;“Good!”@@

Her voice assumes a cheery, saccharine tone, and she smiles with such heavily-feigned friendliness that you almost want to believe it in spite of yourself, despite having been freshly threatened.

@@.cheerBitch;“Well, I’ll leave you to finish up your watergirl duties. See you on Monday!”@@

With a quick, beauty queen wave, Ashley heads towards the gym, followed by her two flunkies. You go to collect the water cart, and do your end of practice duties.

@@.hero;Now what have I gotten myself into?@@
