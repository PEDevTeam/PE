@@.shopphoto;what can I do you for today? Unfortunately I’m working a solo shift right now so I can’t step away to plow your boipussy at the moment.”@@

You explain, that, actually, your teacher told you that you to go on a date with someone this weekend, and you were wondering if she might want to get food later as your date

Roxy almost seems offended by the question.  @@.shopphoto;“What kind of woman do you think I am?”@@ she scoffs. @@.shopphoto;“You think I’m the type of girl that just randomly goes out with customers?”@@

You cringe inside, realizing just how pathetic you probably sounded just now.

However, Roxy is unable to keep a straight face for long, and soon breaks into a laugh. @@.shopphoto;“Ah, who’m I kidding? I am exactly that type of girl! Like I said, I’m pretty busy right now, but my shift ends in like an hour. We could meet up then. How about it?”@@

@@.heroT;“Sounds great!”@@ you say. You thank her and go loiter around the mall to kill time.
