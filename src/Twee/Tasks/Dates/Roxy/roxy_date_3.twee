Roxy does most of the talking as the two of you sit and enjoy your meal. The shake is as good as advertised, as is the burger that you order.

@@.shopphoto;“So, your teacher wants you to ask random people out on dates?”@@ Roxy asks, swallowing a mouthful of burger mid-sentence.

You explain $teacher’s newest “training” and how it requires you to learn how to behave when out with a date.

Roxy laughs. @@.shopphoto;“Well, I might have been the wrong person to ask out. Serious relationships aren’t really for me. I tend to just get bored sticking with one person too long.  Too much good sex out there, if you get me.”@@

@@.heroT;“I guess I get it,”@@ you say with a shrug.  It’s not like you have enough experience to really know what she’s talking about.

She smiles and you feel her hand reach across under the table and start to stroke your inner thigh, sparking an instant reaction in your pants.  @@.shopphoto;“Hey, put any thoughts to what you wanna do after dinner?”@@

@@.heroT;“Umm… not really,”@@ you stammer.

@@.shopphoto;“That’s cool,”@@ she says with a smirk. @@.shopphoto;“I’ve got some ideas. Just leave it to me.”@@

As the dinner continues, you cannot help but notice that Dan seems to spend an unusual amount of time hanging around near your booth. Even worse, Roxy seem to be unabashedly flirting with him whenever he drops by.

@@.malevoice10;“Can I interest you in some desert?”@@ Dan asks as he piles up your dishes.

@@.shopphoto;“Hmm, do you think I could go off-menu?”@@ Roxy asks, her voice dripping with innuendo. @@.shopphoto;"I have a hankering for something like a popsickle... but hot... Would you have anything like that?”@@

@@.hero;This is getting to be too much. I thought she was on a date with me! Maybe I should say something?@@
