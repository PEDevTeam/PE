Arriving at the electronic shop you find Roxy just passing her keys over to the next clerk. Out of her work uniform, she is dressed in a short skater dress and chunky Doc Martens that have her looking a little bit sexy, a little bit punk, and way hot. She turns to greet you with a smile.

@@.shopphoto;“Perfect timing,”@@ she states as she waves to her relief. @@.shopphoto;“Come on, then; there’s a diner right near the mall that makes great burgers.”@@

She grabs you by the hand and leads the way, the two of you winding out of the interior mall and across the parking lot to what looks like a 50’s throwback diner.

It’s obvious that Roxy is a regular as one of the waiters plus the soda jerk behind the “bar” greet the both of you with a wave. Roxy smiles back and pulls you into a corner booth.

It isn’t long before the waiter; a good looking guy about Roxy’s age, comes by with menus.

@@.shopphoto;“That sound’s great, I could go for something... creamy”@@ Roxy says with an impish grin.
