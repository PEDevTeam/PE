You spend some time waiting around in front of the school until you finally see the familiar face of the Jogger approaching from up the street. Catching his eye, you hesitantly wave him over.

An expression of interest picks up on his face as he cruises in your direction. “What’s up?” he asks, jogging in place.

@@.heroT;“So, I, uh, was wondering if you... maybe... wanted to get together sometime?”@@ you ask nervously.

Perhaps not quite getting your meaning, he smiles and says, @@.malevoice6;“Sure! I’m on my last leg of my afternoon jog. I usually hit up the Berry Juice Bar after. How about you come along and join me?”@@

You recall that the Better Berry Juice Bar is about a block or so away, not too bad of a trek<<if _shoes.heels>>, even if you are wearing heels<</if>>.

[[Join him for the rest of his jog|jogger_date_2]]
