	You enter the adult store. After some hesitation, you ask the shopkeeper about the <<if not $tasksTeacher.trialChastity.status eq 1>>chastity device you saw in the Playgirl magazine<<else>>market research opportunity $teacher told you about<<endif>>. She looks a little puzzled.

	@@.shopclothes;“Oh, you must mean the market testing on our new line of chastity cages and anal plugs! Sorry, you’re a lot younger than the normal demographic for those, so I was a little bit confused.”@@

	She begins to describe the contract in full. You notice her beaming smile and can’t help but be reminded of $guardian's. In fact, you notice an overall similarity to $guardian in her appearance, causing some dissonance when you hear her describe the testing trial ahead in explicit terms.

	As the shopkeeper explains it, the company will provide you with a chastity cage and a butt-plug with internal sensors that will collect all necessary data. You just have to spend three nights wearing both devices, and bring them back to the store afterwards. You’ll get $<<print tasksTeacher.trialChastity.rewardMoney>> for participating in the research.

	The thought of having those things //on your cock// and //in your ass// while you’re sleeping doesn’t sound very pleasant, but otherwise it sounds pretty simple.

	You agree, so the shopkeeper takes you to a small cubicle with a curtain instead of a door. She brings several boxes containing chastity cages of various sizes, and a small metal butt-plug. She tells you to find a cage option that fits you and then leaves, noting she’ll be nearby if you need anything.

	You take off your pants \
	<<if _u and (not _u.female)>>\
		and lower your boxers.
	<<elseif _u and (not _u.slutty)>>\
		and lower your panties.
	<<elseif _u>>\
		and lower your lacy panties.
	<<endif>>\

	To your frustration, you've already got a hardon, and can't try on any of the chastity devices. 

	@@.hero;Why the hell do I have an erection?@@

	You aren’t turned on by the idea of locking up your own dick in a cage so you can't get erections. And you’re definitely not turned on by the idea of forcing one of these plugs between your butt cheeks! But how are you supposed to stop thinking about sex, surrounded by all these erotic toys?

	As if on cue, the shopkeeper asks from behind the curtain how your trying-on is going.

	@@.shopclothes;"You know,"@@ she says cheerily, @@.shopclothes;"if you're having trouble, there are a few items that could help in the bottom drawer on the right-hand side."@@
	
	You hope she isn't right about the drawer, because if she is, it means she knows about your 'problem,' and she's probably picturing you naked. The thought doesn't help you, but it does embarrass you further.
	
	You slide open the drawer. You're not sure what you expected, but it wasn't what you find: a huge jumble of vibrators in a multitude of shapes and sizes. There are small, large and simply enormous penises, ranging in material from simple shiny plastic and colorful rubber to uber-realistic synthetic skin. You’re fairly sure this isn’t the drawer she meant, but you’re amazed by the sheer number of fake cocks in there.

	After a few seconds of looking in the bin, your gaze drifts down to your cock, which is now straining painfully erect and throbbing visibly with your every pulse.

	@@.hero;No! It’s not these vibrators that are turning me on – it’s that there’s an attractive shopkeeper just on the other side of the curtain... who might come in here at any moment!@@

	As if mocking you, your cock flexes slightly upward with new tension, and a glistening pearl of fresh precum wells up.

	@@.shopclothes;"We also have a lot of strap-ons, so I could... You know, come in and help you..."@@

	You can't believe what you just heard - what an outrageous offer! However, her similarity to $guardian is playing tricks on your mind. You briefly have an image of $guardian entering your cubicle with a strap-on attached... 
	
	The shopkeeper's giggles break you out of it.
	
	@@.shopclothes;"Sorry, just kidding! Check the next drawer, there are some ice packs that could help you out."@@
	
	You feel your cheeks turn from pink to red as you realize that not only //was// she imagining you with your inexplicable erection, but that you've also just been had - without any strap-on! You take out an ice pack and hold it down against your groin, chasing away any disappointed thoughts about her offer being just a prank.
	
	After some time - a surprisingly long time - your penis shrinks enough for you to start trying on various cages. 
	
	You're no less embarrassed, however. The shopkeeper is still outside the curtain and keeps offering you embarrassing hints and advice - which you can't help but follow. She's got your situation figured out well enough to give you dead-on advice, and she's giving you orders which you feel like you're just submissively complying with. You feel like some weak-willed sissy who gets off on being dominated! 
	
	As you finally find and wear a cage that fits you, she tells you in detail how to put in the butt-plug. Her lurid choice of directions are better suited to an erotic novel, so you guess she's still fucking with you. It's working, though. You press the metal of the plug against your anus, feeling cold and pressure; against your will, your penis stirs again. By the time you feel the plug seat into place, you're deeply mortified and flustered.

	You hastily finish and dress. You're immediately aware of the slowly-warming but unyielding lump of butt-plug inside your rectum, as well as the turgid shaft of your penis straining painfully against its tormenting new cage. You take a deep breath and try shrug off the discomfort, but then you are confronted by the fact you still have to go out like this. 
	
	The shopkeeper is waiting. She knows exactly what you've done to yourself, and what you're hiding under your clothing.

	You're beet red as you emerge. You keep your head down, unable to meet her eyes, but a furtive glance as you sidle by tells you she's smiling widely. You mumble excuses in hopes of making a hasty exit, but she cheerfully replies with more words of humiliating, parting advice instead.
	
	@@.shopclothes;"See you again in a few days,"@@ she says. @@.shopclothes;"//Have fun!//"@@

	Unable to bear more, you scurry out of the store with what's left of your shrunken self-respect.

	<<else>>\
		She asks you to return tested products and hands you a large cardboard box labeled ‘Test Articles’ in bold, red letters alongside several biohazard stickers.\
	<<endif>>\
	You place the items in the plastic liner within, grateful that at least the box doesn’t have your name on it or anything.

	She takes the box from you and seals it up with adhesive strips already mounted to the flaps. Then, she writes your name on the label with a big marker and puts the box on the center... //most obvious... most visible...// shelf behind the counter.

	@@.shopclothes;“Can’t be too careful with those things, you know?”@@ she says. @@.shopclothes;“Don’t really know where they’ve been..."@@

	She briefly eyes your groin and then looks up at you with you a suggestive tilt of her eyebrows.

	@@.shopclothes;“Well, I guess we //do// know, don’t we?”@@

	Your cheeks begin to turn pink, and she smirks.

	@@.shopclothes;"You know, we don't get many testers around your age or um, ‘physique,’ so your feedback will be very helpful. It’s not often we get someone whose trial results could easily apply to both males and females! We are one of the leading companies in this market, and we are constantly trying to refine our designs for enjoyment by everyone, even those, like you, who aren’t so... let’s say, //‘well endowed’//."@@

	@@.hero;Wait, did she just say that I’m...?@@

	Your face goes from pink to red, and it's all you can do to just nod.

	@@.shopclothes;"You know, most subjects think this trial is easy money, but they often find it very hard to sleep in these devices. Men, particularly, tend to take a lot of time to get used to our products. Now, there are those rare natural sissies, who get used to it right away, in a few days. But it takes a really submissive..."@@

	She continues on, but your cheeks are burning red already and you don't dare meet her eyes. @@.hero;All this must make me seem meek and subservient!@@ you realize, in shame.

	To make matters worse, now that the chastity cage is off, you feel your penis swelling involuntarily, rubbing soft fabric after so much deprivation of sensation. Your eyes widen, but there’s nothing you can do. You are soon fully erect right in front of the shopkeeper. Oh god, she’s going to think you are turned on by all this!

	She's been speaking with her eyes focused on your face, but when she glances downward, she suddenly trails off mid-sentence. You hope it's because she's just implied you are a super-submissive sissy, not because she's seen your erection, but neither option is actually good.

	She just says, @@.shopclothes;“Oh...”@@

	And, she’s looking right at your tent pole. She looks a little embarrassed, and amused, but she recovers quickly. You, on the other hand, feel like you have a fever in your ears and cheeks. She forces a straight face, but her eyes keep twinkling.

	@@.shopclothes;“Yeah, um... I’m just going to grab some forms for the trial from the back.”@@

	Fortunately, by the time she's returned, you've managed to shift your less-erect penis into a position where it's not so instantly obvious. You hope.

	@@.shopclothes;“So, for the research, I can pay you for your time like we agreed, but sometimes we have testers who find they... //really like// using our products. As a second option, you could write a review, describing your experience, and I’ll give you a free chastity cage and butt-plug, similar to the ones you used in your testing, instead."@@
	
	<<if $tasksTeacher.trialChastity.cooldown eq 1>>\
	Your first reaction is to take the money, but you think it over:

	@@.hero;I still need a chastity to show $teacher, and both items would cost more if I just buy them in the store. I could save some cash by taking these items, but damn, I don't want to write up how it felt!@@

<<elseif $tasksTeacher.trialChastity.progress eq 12>>\
	You choose the items.
	
	The shopkeeper guides you over to a desk, then hands you the company's product testing feedback form and a pen. You sit down to write your review, describing your experience during the trial.
	
	You start with dry formal language, but as you recall your thoughts and feelings over those frustrating days and restless nights, your descriptions grow more colorful and intimate. 
	
	As you reach the end of the form, you stop and review it. Somehow, despite your intentions, it reads like you enjoyed wearing the damned things! Before you revise anything, the shopkeeper snatches the paper up.

	@@.shopclothes;"Perfect!"@@
	
	As you stand, she hefts two chunky clamshell packages towards you, one at a time - your new chastity device and butt-plug. You have to cradle your arms to carry them. The garish packaging is splashed with colorful pornographic images of jack-booted dominas and harness-bound slaves, and the devices are prominently visible in their vacuum-formed windows. You sure are glad you’re not going to be lugging these around in public.

	@@.shopclothes;"Both items are rightfully yours now, so congratulations! I'm sure your feedback will be //so// helpful in improving the personal satisfaction of our customers! I should caution that, due to prototype variations, the actual production version I gave you of the cage is a bit tighter and the plug is a bit larger than what you wore in testing. However, I'm sure that will only make them fit //even more perfectly// on you!"@@
	
	As you try to find words to ask permission to use a dressing cubicle, she turns to review your form, but you catch her stifling a snicker after she's barely begun. You flush red... maybe you’d better leave before you dig your grave deeper. 

	@@.shopclothes;"Was there something else you needed? Oh... you’re one of those who //really likes// our products. Say no more!”@@

	She abruptly leads you by the hand back to the cubicle, this time joining you inside. As she unpacks the devices, puts on some latex gloves and gets some items from a cabinet, she tells you to drop your pants. At the sound of her no-nonsense tone, you comply before you can really think about it, standing there in bewilderment at your automatic obedience.
	
	<<if _u and (not _u.female)>>\
		She quirks an eyebrow, looking at your boxers. She swiftly pulls them down, exposing your penis.
	<<elseif _u and (not _u.slutty)>>\
		She smiles at the sight of your panties. She swiftly pulls them down, exposing your penis.
	<<elseif _u>>\
		She gives you a knowing smile upon seeing your naughty panties, then swiftly pulls them down to expose your penis.
	<<endif>>\

	Without warning, she presses a small ice pack against your cock, making you yelp in surprise. You start to argue, but the shopkeeper shushes you, holding the pack in place until the cold is nearly unbearable. She finally sets it aside. Then literally (but gently), she takes you by the balls for leverage, expertly locking the new cage around your shivering, deflated penis. You gingerly touch the outer shell in disbelief.

	Then, something slick and cold presses against your rectum and slides inside. Shocked once more, you see the shopkeeper now has one hand extended behind your rear and the other on your hip. She pushes hard on the butt-plug until it fully penetrates you, making your anus clench around the lump of cold metal.

	Your cheeks are burning up as you shamefully realize you just let a near-stranger lock you into a chastity cage and shove a butt-plug up your ass. What’s more, her frisky smile reveals she knows it turned you on! 

	As if by silent agreement, you both look down at your freshly-installed chastity cage. Your pink dick starts growing flush, compressed grotesquely against the plastic as it tries to grow bigger than the cage will allow. She looks back up at you, but you can only stare meekly and ashamedly down at your bound and powerless dick in response. You try to find the willpower to look her in the eyes, but you simply can't bring yourself to do it. Worse, this only makes your dick squirm even harder, and your cheeks flame beet red.
	
	At last the shopkeeper hands you the key for the chastity cage, and you put your lower garments back in place while she gets rid of her gloves. Without further ado, she leads you back into the store. From there, your feet find their own motivation and take you quickly on your way.

	The shopkeeper thanks your for your cooperation with the company's product testing research, then heads for the register to ring up your payment transaction. She rapidly keys the point of sale computer, scans a few codes taped to the counter with a sensor, and punches a few more buttons. The register only makes a short, unpleasant 'boop-boop' sound in reply.
	
	The shopkeeper's face scrunches in frustration. She runs through the entire process again, biting her lip when the same result occurs a second time. She taps one key over and over rapidly, groaning.
	
	In the meantime, an attractive young couple enters the store, browsing the section containing the more vanilla novelties for casual play. They relax and enjoy themselves, which is the opposite of your own experience.
	
	@@.shopclothes;"Sorry, hold on a sec...@@" the shopkeeper says.
	
	Her brows furrow as she stares at the screen. She bangs the counter loudly and swears under her breath. As she does this, the couple begin to pay closer attention to your ordeal, whispering to one another and glancing up at you. Finally, the shopkeeper picks up her cellphone and dials someone. She begins speaking loudly into the phone:
	
	@@.shopclothes;"Um, hi. It's me... I have a product test I need to ring up, but the stupid register won't let me. Can you help?"@@
	
	The shopkeeper's voice easily carries through the whole store. The couple watches more closely, visibly intrigued.
	
	@@.shopclothes;"Yes... He did the chastity cage and the butt-plug... Yes, the three nights... Yes, I checked - he had them on."@@
	
	She types a new series of keys and scans the codes again, as the young couple stars chatting in amusement. As they talk, the woman in the couple makes a 'thumbs up' gesture towards her behind, the man with her makes a closed fist and puts his finger inside, and then they both burst into laughter. @@.hero;Damn it.@@
	
	The shopkeeper nods a few times to the voice on the other end of the line, coaxing the register along as she goes. Finally, it cooperates, and the cash drawer springs open.
	
	@@.shopclothes;"Here we go! Are two twenties okay with you?"@@
	
	The couple laughs uproariously upon hearing the price at which you... @@.hero;rented my ass and penis for research.@@

	OLD SCENE Selkie thinks you could use this later, with the excuse of coming in for a second round of testing, perhaps of an even more advanced device? And she could do this because of their familiarity (and because she knows it secretly turn the player on!)

	She tells you to lower your pants as she holds the devices. A bit overwhelmed by her no-nonsense tone and manner of speech, you comply before you can really think about it. Then stand there blushing bright red from your automatic obedience.
	
	<<if _u and (not _u.female)>>\

	You don't have time to react as she places a small ice pack against your groin, making you yelp in surprise. You try to argue, but the shopkeeper shushes you, removing the ice pack and expertly locking a chastity cage onto your shivering penis. As you touch it in disbelief something slick and cold slides up your anus! Shocked, you meet the eyes of the shopkeeper, who winks at you as she pushes the butt-plug until it pops in, making your anus clench around its cold metal.
	
	Your cheeks are burning up as you shamefully realize that you've just let a near-stranger lock you into a chastity cage and put a butt-plug into your anus! And the heated smile she gives you tells she knows that the fact that that just happened has turned you on! As if by silent agreement, you both look down at your freshly-installed chastity cage, where your pink dick is flushed and squished in as it tries to grow bigger than the cage will allow. You feel her eyes on your face as it burns even brighter, and once again you want to lift your head and meet her eyes, instead of staring meekly and ashamedly down at your bound and powerless dick... but you simply can't bring yourself to do it! Which makes your dick squirm even harder, and your cheeks flame beet red!
	
	At last the shopkeeper hands you the key for the chastity cage, grabs your hand and leads you out from the changing cubicle, not giving you time to remove your new accessories. Before letting you go she leans in and whispers that she didn't have to do all this, but she loves to help people 'like yourself' who really, deep down, appreciate the attention and guidance of a stronger minded woman.
	And then she leans in close against your ear. @@.shopclothes;"Oh, and perhaps you might like to sign up for our special trial, with this new device? It has some new features."@@ She taps a bright red fingernail against the key that you're clutching so tightly in your hand. @@.shopclothes;"If you'd like to register online, and enter the code number you'll see is etched on your key, you'll be automatically entered into our new Key Holder system, where specially-trained staff will monitor your devices, and choose whether to enable the mechanical lock to function or not. From time to time, your key mistress will assign you special tasks to enable your cage to be unlocked. Normally, that service would cost you $50 per week, but during the trial period, it's completely free! Or, if you prefer, we can assign the task and unlocking functions to someone who's a little more... intimately acquainted with you. Your choice: you can provide an email address for another person to take control. But don't try to fool us - you need to provide credentials to prove that your key holder is someone other than you, Sweetie! The details are all here."@@ She slips a card into your other hand.
