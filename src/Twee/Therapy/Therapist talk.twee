	The clock on the wall ticks slower with every passing minute. You don't want to talk about your escapades into $guardian's bedroom if you can avoid it, but you're running out of things to say. Then, it's out of your hands.
	
	@@.therapist;"I'm really enjoying chatting with you, $player.name, but I think it's time we discuss why you're here."@@
	
	A chill shoots up your spine, and dread twists your stomach.
	
	@@.therapist;"The truth is, I'm not here to solve $guardian's problems. I'm here to help you."@@ You scrunch your nose in confusion, and she smiles. @@.therapist;"I don't intend to scare you, to make you uncomfortable, or to tell you what to do. I will, if you'll let me, help you figure out solutions to your problems. Solutions which don't include stealing things out of your<<if $kink.incest>>mother's<<else>>guardian's<<endif>> room. Just between you and me though, if I were a teenage boy with a <<if $kink.incest>>mother<<else>>guardian<<endif>> as gorgeous as yours, I'm pretty much sure she would have caught me in her dresser, too."@@
	
	You're not sure if she's being serious, but her reaction seems genuine, and you find her words very reassuring. It feels good to settle your worries - you're glad you came to the session.
	
	//@@.hero;She's so cool - I really feel like I could open up to her about things.@@//

	$therapist had made it clear that you could talk to her about //anything,// but this particular topic is really embarrassing. You hesitate, inwardly questioning whether it's appropriate to discuss with her. But then, if not with a licensed therapist, who else? After a while, $therapist notices your squirming, and calls you on it.
	
	@@.therapist;"$player.name, I've had a lot of training in reading people's body language, and I can tell you want to talk about something. Whatever it is, I'm here to listen."@@ She gives you one of her encouraging smiles.
	
	Unable to resist her charm, you tell her about wearing panties to school. You leave out a lot of details - for instance, how you acquired the pair of panties you wore - but nevertheless, you rush through the main points and get the incident off your chest.
	
	@@.therapist;"You seem really stressed about this whole thing - what drove you to do it in the first place?"@@
	
	Red as a ripe tomato, you lower your eyes to the floor and mumble an explanation that includes nothing about $teacher - you're unsure whether you say anything believable, let alone comprehensible. To your relief, $therapist lets that particular question drop, and she moves on.
	
	@@.therapist;"From the way you were acting, I thought you were going to drop a bombshell on me. You wore girl's underwear to school? So what?"@@ She shrugged, and you stare at her, gobsmacked by her casual dismissal. @@.therapist;"I wore panties when I went to school too."
	
	@@.heroT;"But you're, uh, a girl."@@
	
	@@.therapist;"So? Were those panties really uncomfortable, or something?"@@
	
	@@.heroT;"N-No, but..."@@ Why wasn't she getting it? @@.heroT;"They weren't uncomfortable, but panties are for //girls.// Boys don't wear them."@@
	
	@@.therapist;"Are you sure? What if a whole bunch of your male classmates were wearing panties too - how would you even know?"@@
	
	For a moment, you imagine your classroom full of boys wearing frilly panties. It's a weird image.
	
	@@.therapist;"Let's forget about the whole //should// or //shouldn't.// Just describe to me how it felt, wearing panties."@@

	@@.heroT;"Well, they were definitely softer than my usual boxers, and they kind of stuck to me instead of hanging loose,"@@ you say,\<<if _u and _u.female>>\ trying to describe the feeling of wearing them. You almost use the present tense, but stop yourself in time.

	@@.therapist;"Your... Oh..."@@ She smiles knowingly. @@.therapist;"Well, from that kind of description, it seems you enjoyed the experience. Try to focus on the positives, alright?"@@
	
	You open you mouth, wanting to argue, but under her questioning gaze you slump back down. No point in arguing with her, given what you've just said.

		Extremely embarrassed, you mumble in the affirmative.

		She suddenly leans toward you, deadly serious. In a false whisper, she says, @@.therapist;"And I'm wearing panties now, too."@@ She widens her eyes dramatically, like she just revealed the killer in a murder mystery.
		
		You stare at $therapist, dumbfounded by her goofy reply. Moments later, you both start to giggle. The tension falls away, and you realize you don't mind talking about such things with her.

	@@.hero;She's a therapist, $player.name. You can trust her.@@
	
	After a deep breath, you open up and tell her that not only did you wear a chastity cage to school, but a butt-plug as well.
	
	@@.therapist;"And?"@@ She asks, nonplussed. 
	
	@@.heroT;"Why aren't you surprised?"@@
	
	@@.therapist;"Well, I took a comprehensive sexuality analysis course while I was getting my degree, and based on what I learned I would say it's a common practice to wear a butt-plug in addition to a chastity cage. In certain social circles, anyways. So what's troubling you about it, other than the obvious fact your teacher is blackmailing you to do it?"@@
	
	@@.heroT;"Err...it makes me feel weird. I have no idea why anyone would use it with a chastity device - it makes it so much //harder// to deal with the cage when I have my butt-plug in."@@

	You blink dumbly at her, and she smiles at your confused expression.
	
	@@.hero;What?@@ @@.heroT;"What?"@@
	
	@@.therapist;"Based on what I learned in that class, your chastity device prevents you from accessing a normal method of relieving your sexual tension, which over time causes an increased and constant level of arousal. When a butt-plug is added to the equation, your sexual tension increases exponentially. In short - the whole point is to make you uncontrollably horny, while denying you any sexual release."@@
	
	@@.heroT;"But, but..."@@
	
	@@therapist;"Actually,"@@ therapist interupts, her eyes alight. @@.therapist;"Have you noticed any...//side effects,// when you stay excited for a prolonged period of time while wearing both your cage and your plug?@@

	@@.therapist;"Oooh..."@@ $therapist grins. @@.therapist;"But it's a perfectly natural physiological response. Girls do it all the time when they get really excited."@@

		<<case 0>>You reflexively blush, embarrassed, but also are a little relieved.
		<<case 1>>You reflexively blush, both embarrassed and pleased by her strange compliment.
		<<case 2>>You reflexively blush, pleased by prospect of falling under a popular trend in fashion, according to $therapist words.

	@@.therapist;"I also wanted to ask, how is your problem with the chastity cage? Did your 'adjustment' help you feel better?"@@
	
	You blush even harder and admit that since your penis shrunk, the cage has become relatively comfortable. It's still snug, but the feeling has become familiar, pleasant even  - at least, when your penis isn't trying to get hard.
	
	@@.therapist;"You see, that's another benefit of having smaller penis."@@
	
	You talk bit more, with $therapist describing various famous actors, artists and successful historical figures of 'less-than-average size,' and how they drew inspiration from it.
	
	You learn how Greek society famously connected large girth with low intelligence, and idealized 'physically enlightened' men with smaller endowments in its statues and frescoes. Or, how certain other ancient cultures felt that smallness or even castration were indicative of virtue and fortitude, and based selection for their elite soldiery on it.
	
	One story in particular surprises you the most. A singer, infamously known as Casanova, historically seduced women, leaving a long trail of broken hearts in his path. His exploits rippled through contemporary society, creating scandal and inspiring public confrontation between even well-to-do women, and he did it all despite being less-than-adequately endowed.
	
	Some of it sounds like anecdotes or made-up stories, but apparently, it's all well-documented.
	
	In the end, your talk with $therapist doesn't reassure you completely, but you think she may have a point about the positive aspects of this unfortunate event.
