	You don't really want to talk about it, but she's been cool so far. The reason you're here still hangs unsaid, though. It eats at you, that she hasn't mentioned you being caught in $guardian's bedroom.
	
	You start by asking $therapist how people decide to sign on for therapy, but $therapist easily sees through you and goes straight to the core.
	
	@@.therapist;"Well, I didn't want to bring it up until you were ready to talk about it. The truth is..."@@
	
	She pauses and you freeze in your seat, dreading her judgment. You really don't want her to be mad or angry with you.
	
	@@.therapist;"The truth is, I'm not here to solve $guardian's problems. I'm here to help //you.//"@@ She smiles seeing your confused face.
	
	@@.therapist;"It's my job to assist you in solving your problems, not to tell you what to do or not to do. Your incident with being too curious with $guardian's things is actually understandable. Just between you and me, if I were a teenage boy with\
	a <<if $kink.incest>>mother<<else>>guardian<<endif>> as gorgeous as yours, I'm pretty much sure she would have caught me in her dresser, too."@@
	
	You are not sure if she's being serious, but she seems genuine about it. You weren't expecting that, and find her words very reassuring. It feels good to lose that worry - you're really glad you've decided to talk about it.
	
	@@.hero;She's so cool. What's best is that she totally gets me!@@

	$therapist said you could talk to her about anything, but it's really embarrassing. You hesitate and question yourself whether it's even appropriate to discuss it with her. Finally, $therapist notices your squirming and calls you on it.
	
	@@.therapist;"$player.name, I can see you obviously want to talk about something. Spill it."@@ She gives you one of her encouraging smiles.
	
	Unable to resist her charms, you tell her about wearing panties to school. You leave out some embarrassing details - for instance, how you got the panties you wore - but you rush through the main points and get the incident off your chest.
	
	Red as a tomato, you lower your eyes and mumble explanations, unsure whether you managed to get it believable or even comprehensible. To your relief, though, $therapist doesn't laugh at you and seems actually intrigued.
	
	@@.therapist;"So, how did it feel? Did you like it?"@@
	
	@@.heroT;"What?! No!"@@ 
	
	@@.therapist;"Was it that bad? Was it so uncomfortable?"@@

	@@.heroT;"Well, no. It wasn't uncomfortable, but panties are for //girls.// Boys don't wear them."@@
	
	@@.therapist;"You sure? What if some of your classmates wear panties too? You would never know."@@

	That thought had actually never occurred to you. For a moment, you imagine your classroom with boys wearing frilly panties. It's so weird and confusing, you don't even know how to argue with $therapist.
	
	@@.therapist;"Let's forget about the whole //should or shouldn't//. Just describe how it felt, please."@@
	
	@@.heroT;"Well, it was soft to the touch and held me, instead of hanging loose like my usual boxers,"@@ you say,\

	@@.therapist;"Your... Oh..."@@ She smiles knowingly. @@.therapist;"I see. From your descriptions, it seems you enjoyed it."@@
	
	You open you mouth, wanting to argue, but under her questioning gaze you slump back down. No point in arguing with her, given what you've just said.
	
	<<if _u and _u.female>>\
		Suddenly she asks: @@.therapist;"I'm curious. Are you wearing panties right now?"@@

		Extremely embarrassed, you nod and mumble confirmation.
		
		She gives you a look. Blushing furiously, you say a bit louder, @@.heroT;"Yes, I'm wearing panties now."@@
		
		She suddenly leans toward you, deadly serious. In a false whisper, she says, @@.therapist;"And I'm wearing panties now, too."@@ She widens her eyes dramatically, like she just revealed the killer in a murder mystery.
		
		You stare at $therapist, dumbfounded by her goofy reply. Moments later, you both dissolve in giggles. The tension falls away, and you realize you don't mind talking about such things with her.
		
		As you calm down, she continues.\

	$therapist notices you fidgeting, and asks if you want to talk about whatever is troubling you.
	
	You don't know how to even start, but $therapist somehow manages to guess.
	
	@@.therapist;"Is it about something $teacher is //making// you do?"@@
	
	@@.heroT;"Well, yes."@@ You still hesitate, considering whether you should tell her.
	
	@@.therapist;"Look, you've already talked to me about other things, so spill it. I won't tell anyone, pinky swear."@@ She quickly reaches over, hooking your pinky finger with her own before you can put your guard up. You both laugh a little.
	
	@@.hero;Of course, she won't tell - she's a therapist.@@ Still, her silly demeanor helps you relax.
	
	After a deep breath, you open up and tell her that in addition to the chastity cage, you wore a butt-plug in your ass when you went to school.
	
	@@.therapist;"And?"@@ She doesn't seem surprised.
	
	@@.heroT;"You're not surprised?"@@
	
	@@.therapist;"Well, I would say it's a common practice to have a butt-plug if you wear a chastity cage. For some definition of //common// of course. So what's troubling you?"@@
	
	You're a bit surprised by her words, but hope she may have some expertise and can help you.
	
	@@.heroT;"It makes me feel weird. I have no idea why it's supposed to go with a chastity device. It actually makes it much harder to deal with the cage when I have my butt-plug in."@@
	
	@@.therapist;"Hmm... How exactly does it make it harder?"@@ You're pretty sure she knows the answer already, but just wants you to say it.
	
	@@.heroT;"Well. It makes it hard... Erm, harder to relax. Yeah, hard to relax."@@ You struggle to find words.  But that's all you can come up with before your thoughts start going in circles.
	
	@@.therapist;"Oh, I see. So while the butt-plug makes it //hard//, the chastity doesn't let you relax. Is that it?"@@ You suspect she's just teasing you, but not trusting your mouth you just nod.
	
	@@.therapist;"Well, the good news is that nothing is wrong. Butt-plugs are supposed to do that."@@ She smiles at your confused expression.
	
	@@.hero;What?@@ @@.heroT;"What?"@@
	
	@@.therapist;"The whole point is to stay constantly aroused. And a butt-plug helps immensely with that."@@
	
	@@.heroT;"Wha-? How?"@@
	
	@@.therapist;"I'm pretty sure you've browsed various erotic materials on the net. Everyone has. So this is something like that, but kind of more public, which makes it more exciting."@@
	
	@@.heroT;"But, but..."@@
	
	@@.therapist;"No buts. Let me guess something. When you stay excited for a prolonged period with the chastity and butt-plug, what happens?"@@
	
	@@.hero;Oh god, she means...@@ You quickly shake your head @@.heroT;"Nothing. Nothing happens."@@ You don't want to admit it, but your furious blush betrays you.

	@@.heroT;"I... Ok..."@@ Your thoughts still in disarray, you can't yet take in the implications of $therapist's intense query. You find the whole topic very embarrassing, but to your shame you're also extremely aroused by it.
