		So far, you’ve only had one unsuccessful attempt at dancing with a stranger. You hesitate, looking at the throngs of people out on the floor who will probably be watching you as soon as you attempt $teacher’s task. Your heart starts beating faster just thinking about it. You decide you don’t feel nearly comfortable enough to do this without first making a couple of attempts to dance with someone else, that don’t involve taking off your clothes.

		[[You change your mind|Club dance floor][$scene="danceFloor"]]
	<<elseif ($player.perversion.danceClub eq 3)>>\
		For a moment, you hesitate, debating whether to go out on the floor and do what $teacher asked, but you can’t quite get up the nerve to follow through. You’ve only actually danced with one other person in this club. Even though that ended up being fun, it was pretty stressful, without having to strip any clothes off your body.

		Maybe I should get some more practice first.

		[[You change your mind|Club dance floor][$scene="danceFloor"]]
	<<else>>\
		As you step onto the dance floor, your senses are filled by the intense experience. The throb of the bass track provokes something visceral inside you, compelling your body to move, and the heavy synths and ethereal vocal tracks make your pulse race. You aren’t dancing yet, but you feel your body fall into time with the rhythm, and everything feels accelerated.

		The semi-darkness over the floor is splashed and sliced by visual effects, with everything from laser beams to two-story motion graphics flashing and sweeping through your vision. It adds a surreal feeling to the room and the crowds around you, as everyone you see alternates between silhouette and color-tinted flashes in strobe-like motion.

		You venture deeper into the crowds of dancers around you, looking for someone with whom to complete $teacher’s latest with.

		<<if $player.perversion.teacher gte 5>>\
			You’ve already been out in public in both girls’ clothes and without underwear on, but knowing you’re about to take off the panties you are wearing right now, to give them to some complete stranger you have to search for, carries its own special embarrassment. It’s one thing to flirt with the risk of being discovered exposed, and quite another to be forced to orchestrate the exposure yourself.
		<<else>>\
			You can’t believe you’re about to do this. You’ve never even left your house without underwear on before, never mind a crowded place like this one. It’s a special kind of embarrassment to have to search out a stranger to give your panties to, knowing your first real public exposure is going to be one you have to orchestrate yourself.
		<<endif>>\

		There are hundreds of people crowding the floor, but it actually feels hard to find the right someone as you begin to make out groups of friends, couples and others who seem occupied. Then, there are people that you just sense would react badly to what you’re planning, or who are too intimating for you to even approach.

		It rules out a surprisingly large number of people. You’re glad $teacher wasn’t very specific.

		Eventually, you see a few you think you can at least approach:

	You walk over by the guy in the polyester track suit, who is dancing as you stop nearby. You see that the crowd has given him a little space to work in, so you just watch as he dances for a bit. 

	His footwork and physicality are borderline professional, and his steps are as entertaining as they are impressive to watch. His athletic style of street dancing combines traditional movements and upper body gestures with more contemporary locks, freezes and even some power moves. 

	He reminds you of one of the classic silver-age dancers you saw in an old black-and-white movie once, except that he sometimes seems to take a break from gravity altogether with the things he pulls off.

	He’s a little flashy, sure, but graceful, too. He has a kind smile, and he’s extremely courteous to other people on the floor. In the end, you get the sense that he’s not here trying to showing off – you think he just really enjoys cutting loose and having fun with everyone. That at least takes off some of the pressure you feel at what you’ve come here to do.

	You hardly have any dance experience to speak of, by comparison, so you don’t dare try to compete. You’ll have to dance with him to complete $teacher’s task, but you find nothing suitable to say or do to make it happen. You stand on the edge of his dance circle, thinking.

	You startle even yourself when you blurt out:

	@@.heroT;“Could you, maybe, show me how to dance?”@@

	A rush of embarrassment comes over you, but he actually hears you and comes over. A bunch of people clap for him appreciatively, then go back to dancing on their own, leaving you space to talk. 

	You try to think of a way to back out, but it’s too late. Maybe that’s ok?

	He smiles pleasantly, and says, @@.malevoice6;“Sure, I can show you some things, if you want. But you gotta start with the basic rule.”@@

	@@.heroT;“What’s that?”@@ you ask, looking up at him.

	@@.malevoice6;“Always have fun, of course! Now, try to follow me. It’s easy, you’ll see.”@@

	He has no idea what you’ve really just gotten yourself into, but you try to take his advice and get your body to relax a little. 

	He steps closer and begins a basic swaying motion, with a simple side-to-side step that isn’t very difficult to mimic. He adds a little swing of his arms to it, and you try to mirror that, too. He nods and encourages you with his easy smile, and you both go on like this for a little while.

	He puts his hands on your hip and shoulder, and with a gentle touch he corrects your initial mistakes. You’ve never had much of a natural physical sense, so you feel awkward, but as he moves your body into balance, you start to feel more stable. 

	He adds a few variations, and this time they’re a little easier to get used to. Suddenly, you’re really dancing together, and a tiny bloom of confidence buds as you try blending the few simple steps he’s shown you on your own.

	Too bad you can’t keep that bloom - dancing with this stranger is only half your task. Your confidence wilts away before it blossoms.
	 
	<<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>\
		While you don’t actually enjoy dancing with a guy, you actually found dancing with him kind of fun, and he’s obviously a decent teacher. You’ve never actually had anyone make you feel this easy on your feet, despite several prior attempts at your mom’s urging when you were younger.

		A pang of remorse hits you when you’re reminded of what you have to do for $teacher, and your eye contact loses its staying power.
	<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\ 
		A pang of remorse hits you as you look at his earnest, smiling face and feel him leading you. This is about as comfortable as you’ve ever been moving on your feet, and though you don’t really like the fact you’re dancing with a guy, he is, without question, a fantastic dancer and teacher.

		After what you’re about to do for $teacher, you probably won’t ever be able to even look at him again. You’re surprised to find you regret that a little.
	<<else>>\
		You feel a pang of remorse as you feel the strength of his arms, leading you. His earnest smile made you feel relaxed and confident dancing, if only for a moment, and you never thought you could even feel like that with someone… especially on a dance floor.

		After what you’re about to do for $teacher, you probably won’t ever be able to even look at him again. It’s surprising to you how much you regret that.
	<<endif>>\

	@@.heroT;“Um, there’s something I have to give you,”@@ you say contritely.

	He backs away a step or two, and his eyes try to read yours in confusion. You sink a little at his expression. You notice there are still numerous people around you here, too, and that just makes it worse, because you just won’t be able to explain anything.

	You take a deep breath. In a single, quick motion, you reach under your dress, slip your thumbs through the fabric around your hips, and tug your <<print _u.name.toLowerCase()>> down. You kneel some as you pull, doing your best not to flash anything you don’t have to, though you can’t hide everything.

	At the last, completely awkward moment, you slide your panties around your shoes until the gusset slips past and they spring free into your palm. You stand up, and thrust your panties toward your dance partner.

	Out of reflex, he catches them in his fist, a look of bewilderment fading his usual smile. He barely seems to comprehend what you just did, lifting your undergarment up by his thumb and index finger as he looks at it in disbelief.

	Some nearby members of the crowd see what you did, and start laughing and pointing loudly at you, drawing immediate attention.

	@@.malevoice6;“Wait - I don’t understand…”@@ your former dance partner stammers, looking at you with confusion.

	Though his concern for you seems genuine, an explosive chain reaction of mocking laughter now surrounds you. It rapidly escalates into a cruel uproar, all directed your way.

	Crushed, you rush away through the crowd, tears gathering at the corners of your eyes.

<<elseif $scene eq "girlTubeDress">>\
	You walk across the dance floor to the tattooed girl you spotted. 

	You find it pretty easy to keep track of her in the crowd despite her shorter height, thanks to her vivid blue hair, which practically glows in the lights of the club. Her hair, pale skin, slight figure, whimsical ink, knee-high boots and the fanciful cut of her tube dress give her an otherworldly, fairy-like look, but there’s an edge to it.

	She’s still dancing by herself by the time you’re close enough to decide what to do. You watch her for a moment, trying to think of what to say so you can dance with her.

	She dances at half-tempo to the club music, swaying slowly despite the driving rhythm. Her body follows long, smooth arcs channeled upward by the motion of her legs and hips, and her arms curve with her movements in flowing, complimentary curves. She’s dancing in place, but she seems like she’s floating.

	<<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>\
		Almost immediately, you begin having second thoughts about approaching her, mostly stemming from being in awe of her ethereal beauty. Your faltering courage at the idea of asking her to dance, while dressed like a girl yourself, slows your feet even more.

		You try to imagine yourself in different circumstances, as a regular guy, striding over to talk to her. It fails almost immediately – you’d never even make it past the door at a club like this if you were your normal self, never mind working up the bravery to talk to someone like her.

		Thinking ahead to what you’re going to do for $teacher’s task, your last bit of confidence flutters away.
	<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\ 
		You begin to hesitate to approach her, conscious of your own appearance and how much it pales in comparison to hers. Not that you’re jealous of how she looks – it’s just that maybe it’ll draw more attention to yourself by how lacking you are in comparison to her, if you’re dancing next to her.

		Then a thought hits you – maybe you could learn something from her that would make this whole thing a little less awkward. Even if you don’t really like being dressed like a girl, maybe learning how to move a little like this wouldn’t be such a bad thing?

		Thinking ahead to what you’re planning to do to complete $teacher’s task, you hope she doesn’t judge you harshly.
	<<else>>\
		The closer you get to her, the harder it is to go through with it. You’re taken in by her ethereal beauty and grace, wishing you could be her, there, standing apart among all these people and perfectly at ease in her own skin. You can’t help compare your own feminine appearance against hers, and you feel inadequate.

		Yet, you wonder if there is something that being next to her on the floor would teach you. Maybe dancing with her would help you move more naturally, or even better accept your own feminine side?

		Thinking ahead to the carrying out $teacher’s task, you hope this girl will understand, but you know it’s not that likely.
	<<endif>>\

	Before your brain spins out any further than it already has, you surprise yourself by walking over to her

	[[Ask her to dance|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="girlTubeDress2"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "girlTubeDress2">>\
	You stop just before reaching the girl with the blue hair and tattoos, and while she turns her head and eyes toward you, she doesn’t stop moving. As she continues dancing, she looks you over expectantly, waiting for you to say something.

	@@.heroT;“I was wondering…”@@ you ask, hesitantly, @@.heroT;“…if you would… if I could… dance with you?”@@

	Although you barely get the words out, the girl just nods casually, taking a half-step towards you without interrupting any of the flow of her other movements. One moment, you are standing alone, and in the next she is beside you.

	@@.femvoice6;“You’re the first person to talk to me tonight,”@@ she says. @@.femvoice6;“I was beginning to think I’d done something wrong, so I’m glad you asked.”@@

	Her body continues to sway, and you try to catch up to her lead, making you feel a little disoriented as you try to match her slowed tempo. The bass and rhythmic beat thundering over the club’s system fill your senses and almost compel you to move to their frenetic, driven pace, but her deliberately-halved timing feels lulling, almost hypnotic.

	Your body rebels against your attempts to coordinate your steps, and you feel even more lost as your mind tries to manage the disparity in time and rhythm, and your own serious lack of experience dancing. You watch her closely, trying to will your movements into pattern with hers, but your own overthinking just spalls into frustration and wasted energy.

	In the end, her pale, grey eyes are what hold you in thrall. In the contrast between her smoky, cobalt eye-shadow and brilliant blue hair, their delicate frost draws you in and holds you, at last letting the chaos around you fade into nothing.

	She puts a hand around your own and pulls you closer, and in that moment, it all clicks. You are pulled into her orbit; your bodies are nearly entangled yet not touching, moving together in balanced contrapposto to a rhythm of your own.

	You feel her moving, taste the scent of her in the air, feel her warmth near your skin. You lose track of gravity and time, and for a few thrilling minutes, all the weight of your life slews away and only the girl in blue remains. Euphoria comes over you.

	Then, the weight returns when you remember why you’re really here. The return of $teacher’s task to your mind dampens your mood and you fall out of synch, the moment fading away forever into the stark relief of your regret.

	[[Give her your panties|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="girlTubeDress3"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "girlTubeDress3">>\
	You try to think of something to salvage the situation, or to somehow offset what you’re about to do, but the words you find just don’t seem up to the task.

	@@.heroT;“I – I’m, uh, sorry, but I – I have to do this,”@@ you stammer.

	You take a deep breath, exhaling as you try to control your trembling hands. As the last glow of endorphins dies away, you notice there are still numerous people around you, and that just makes it worse, because you just won’t be able to explain anything.

	In a single, quick motion, you reach under your dress, slip your thumbs through the fabric around your hips, and tug your <<print _u.name.toLowerCase()>> down. You kneel some as you pull, doing your best not to flash anything you don’t have to, though you can’t hide everything. 

	At the last, completely awkward moment, you slide your panties around your shoes until the gusset slips past and they spring free into your palm. You stand up, and thrust your panties toward your dance partner.

	She catches the garment by reflex, holding it up between two fingers in equal parts confusion and disgust as she tries to sort out what you just did and why. Whatever special thing that may have connected the two of you just vanished.

	Unfortunately, she isn’t the only person who saw you, and you’re quickly surrounded by jeers and laughter, aimed at you from behind pointing fingers and cell phone cameras. An explosive chain reaction of mocking laughter rapidly escalates into a cruel uproar, all directed your way.

	Mortified, you rush away through the crowd, tears gathering at the corners of your eyes.

<<elseif $scene eq "guyTopTank">>\
	You walk across the club floor, keeping your bearings on the guy wearing the tank top and dancing like he doesn’t have a care in the world. His whole relaxed demeanor makes you feel slightly better about what you’ve got to do, even though you are fighting back a tidal wave of nerves.

	As you approach, you begin to get a decent look at him: he’s lean, but muscled, and a bit taller than you though not overly so. He is dressed in a simple, unrestricting tank top and a pair of loose-but-well-fitting jeans, and sports a clean, very expensive pair of high-top sneakers.

	He dances with a free, bouncing dance style that doesn’t use a lot of effort but still reveals his coordination and grace. His steps are deliberate but playful, showy enough to look cool but not so flashy as to draw a dedicated audience.

	<<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>\
		You have a lot of reservations about going up to some guy, while you look like a girl, to hand over your panties to someone you’ve never even met. On top of that, you have to dance with him first. The only bright side in this whole thing might be that he seems pretty laid back, making it the tiniest amount more bearable.

		The issues with dancing with another guy are big enough, but at least you don’t have to worry about approaching a woman to do all this. The enormous risk you’d be taking, dropping and then handing your underwear to a female, publicly, makes you shudder.

		There’s no good option there, but at least this guy probably won’t take it too seriously… you hope.
	<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\
		You’re put more at ease by the guy’s laid-back attitude, which makes you a little less worried about a bad reaction to $teacher’s task ahead. Since you don’t really want to dance with a guy, the last thing you need is to be around someone edgy right now – you’re nervous enough as it is. He seems the opposite.

		You hope that some of his confidence and casual manner wear off on you, when you’re close enough.
	<<else>>\
		The guy’s easy-going body language and expression put your mind slightly more at ease with $teacher’s task ahead. You’ve got plenty of reasons to be nervous about this whole thing already, and not having to be around somebody who’s uptight makes that one less problem.

		His casual, confident mood actually does a little more than just relieve you. You start to notice he’s not that hard on the eyes, either.
	<<endif>>\

	As you get within a few paces of the guy in the tank top, he pivots your way, noticing your attention towards him, and he looks you over. You apparently pass his judgement, but he throws you a “what gives” gesture with his palms up and eyebrow raised, without a pause in his basic dance movements.

	Forcing out the first words you can find, you sputter, @@.heroT;“Hi, I, um, was wondering if you maybe want to dance? I mean, with me.”@@

	Not smooth, but it doesn’t strike out – the guy shrugs and nods. With no fuss, he takes a few steps in your direction, still keeping rhythm to the dance music, and raises his arms near his sides and holds out a hand to give you opportunity to partner with him.

	Unsure what to do, you just offer your hand in return. He gently takes it, easing you towards him, and holds you gently by the waist. Patiently, he guides you into a simple swaying motion that brings you in time with him. 

	You feel clumsy at first as you try to get your feet to cooperate, but his firm hold helps to steady you. He nods and there’s a gentle, unhurried sense about him that slowly takes the pressure away – you feel… safe. Before long, you realize you’re relaxed and comfortably in synch as you dance together, and you’re surprised to discover that it’s actually fun.

	Just as you do, however, your thoughts turn back to $teacher’s task. Your security evaporates when you begin to notice just how many people are around you right now. You stumble backward, out of your dance partner’s grasp.

	[[Give him your panties|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="guyTopTank2"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "guyTopTank2">>\
	You search for something to say, but words haven’t really done much for you tonight and they aren’t any help now. With all these people around you, it probably won’t matter what you say anyway.

	@@.heroT;“I’m sorry – I can’t explain, but I have to do this,”@@ you stammer.

	You take a deep breath. In a single, quick motion, you reach under your dress, slip your thumbs through the fabric around your hips, and tug your <<print _u.name.toLowerCase()>> down. You kneel some as you pull, doing your best not to flash anything you don’t have to, though you can’t hide everything. 

	At the last, completely awkward moment, you slide your panties around your shoes until the gusset slips past and they spring free into your palm. You stand up, and thrust your panties toward your dance partner.

	He catches your liberated underwear mostly out of reflex, holding them with a modest but detectable amount of confusion across his face. He looks like someone who just heard the punchline to a nonsense joke and is still trying to figure it out.

	His reaction is less painful than you feared it could be, but others in the crowd saw what you did and soon numerous people are pointing and laughing at you. A ripple of cell phone cameras are raised around you, and you rush away before it gets any worse.

	Your residual thoughts about how good it felt to be led on the dancefloor leave you in deep confusion, adding sting to your embarrassment.

	You cross the dance floor, keeping an eye on the lady in the sleeveless dress standing alone by a small, circular cocktail table. She seems focused on her own thoughts as she slowly nurses a ruby-hued drink from a long-stemmed martini glass.

	She wears a deep brown velvet dress with tonal floral accents, snug at her hip and flared at the hem, which rests over her thighs. Lacy, cream-colored stockings wrap her long, slender legs, which come down to a pair of coordinated two-tone pumps.

	Her hair drapes in loose, chestnut-colored ringlets around her shoulders, framing a perfectly made-up face with a smoldering, elegant look that reminds you of a classic cover girl. Her bare, delicate arms end at gold-bracelet-adorned wrists, from which emerge dainty hands with shiny, manicured nails.

	As you cross the last few paces remaining before you reach her table, you hastily try to come up with something to say. The obligation to complete $teacher’s task is heavy in your mind, and compounds the nervousness you feel in what you’re about to do.

	<<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>\
		The lady in the dress is both incredibly alluring and daunting at the same time. You’ve always been intimidated by certain feminine qualities, and she has them in abundance. As your confidence starts to flicker out, you inwardly kick yourself for picking her for $teacher’s task. Somehow you manage to keep moving forward, focusing on how much harder it would be to face $teacher if you fail.
	<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\
		Your own girly appearance does little to boost your confidence, while her fashionable, sensual look adds greatly to your anxiety. The scale seems tipped very much against you completing your task, but you somehow keep shuffling forward when you think of just how much more afraid you are of failing $teacher.
	<<else>>\
		You can’t help compare the woman’s chic, sensual look to your own facsimile version of girlhood. You just don’t measure up, and you start to question whether you can actually go through with this. 

		Your reluctant feet are spurred forward again when you measure that against your fear of $teacher’s anger.
	<<endif>>\

	You reach her table, words still gestating, and she looks up at your approach. Her eyes quickly parse over you, but you can’t read her reaction with any clarity.

	She picks up her cocktail in her manicured fingertips and sips, her eyelids fluttering as her focus shifts from you to the glass and back. As she withdraws the glass from her lips, a restrained curiosity appears on her face. She says nothing, waiting for you to initiate.

	@@.heroT;“Hi,”@@ you barely muster. @@.heroT;“Do you think… would you like to….?”@@

	@@.femvoice6;“Would I like to what?”@@ she asks, amusement dancing in her eyes.

	Shit, you’re blowing this.

	@@.heroT;“Um… I was just wondering…”@@ You stumble on. @@.heroT;“Do you, maybe, want to dance?”@@

	She looks you over again, taking another, more deliberate sip.

	@@.femvoice6;“No.”@@ she says.

	A lightning bolt of panic hits you, and your mouth drops open. A little rattle sneaks out of your throat as your mind reels. 

	Shit! You’ve blown it!

	@@.femvoice6;“Oh, lighten up, girl,”@@ she says, @@.femvoice6;“I’m just messing with you.”@@

	At your great relief, she takes another sip, emptying her glass, and she leaves it on the cocktail stand.

	@@.femvoice6;“You know what?”@@ she says, @@.femvoice6;“I spent two damned hours getting ready for an epic night out, and I’ve just been standing here for another two hours, all alone. Until you came over, all I’ve gotten out of it were four cosmos I bought myself, that apparently came with a side order of drunken assholes, and a bunch of chicken shits pretending not to stare at my boobs.”@@

	In great relief, you start working through what just happened in your head, but she catches your overthinking and nips it right in the bud.

	@@.femvoice6;“You asked me, I said, ‘yes,’ so let’s go, already!”@@ she laughs. @@.femvoice6;“Get your ass over here before I die of boredom!”@@

	[[Go Dance|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="ladyDress2"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "ladyDress2">>\
	She takes your hand and you wade into the crowded dance floor together. When you get to a spot where there’s a little free room, she turns around and lets you go. She picks a spot in the music and starts dancing. Following along to the very danceable track, you try to join her, struggling for several measures to match her movements.

	@@.femvoice6;“You know what?”@@ she yells over the music, @@.femvoice6;“you kind of suck at this, but I think you’re cute! I’ve decided to like you.”@@

	You just nod your head, not quite sure how to take that feedback. You manage to go with it, despite your mixed emotions. You dance together for a little while, but she watches you with an unsettling intensity the whole time.

	@@.femvoice6;“So, you’re probably not going to believe it, but today’s my birthday,”@@ she shouts. 

	You take in the information, smiling and nodding appreciatively.

	@@.femvoice6;“Well, wish me happy birthday!”@@ she commands.

	You do, and she throws her arms around you in a hug, kisses you uncomfortably hard right on the mouth and then gives you a large-but-pained smile.

	@@.femvoice6;“Thanks! You’re now officially the first and only person I met today who actually gives a shit.”@@

	She starts dancing with her arms around your shoulders, pressing her body into yours a little, and her lead is strong enough that you are soon moving together at her pace. She has a certain wild energy in her movements that feels uncontrolled and a little dangerous.

	@@.femvoice6;“So, what are you going to give me for my birthday?”@@ she asks, leaning into your ear. Her cheek brushes against your cheek as she says it.

	You have no idea how to react to her, and as you search for ideas, she reaches down and grabs your rear end in both hands as she continues to dance. Your whole lower end lights up with a tickling, nervous energy and you squirm a little, but she holds on tightly.

	@@.femvoice6;“This is a pretty good start,”@@ she smirks, squeezing roughly. @@.femvoice6;“Now, your ass is mine… Ha, ha! Just kidding.”@@

	She looks you straight in the eyes, with a little bit of frost in hers.

	@@.femvoice6;“Then again, maybe I’ll keep it.”@@

	While at first you felt like you were the guilty one, looking to pull $teacher’s task on an unsuspecting person, you are starting to feel like the tables have turned.

	Even though you’ve often fantasized about being close to such a beautiful woman, you were well outside your comfort zone when this began and it’s so much worse now. You can’t shake the feeling that you’re just being used as a prop for whatever play she has in mind, and something feels wrong.

	Suddenly, she pulls back and stops dancing, her hands still below your waist. She grins with a certain darkness in her eyes that genuinely scares you.

	@@.femvoice6;“I have to admit something,”@@ she says. @@.femvoice6;“It’s not actually my birthday. I just like presents.”@@

	Before you even recognize what she’s doing, the woman squats down and reaches under your dress with both hands.

	[[You freeze up|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="ladyDress3"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "ladyDress3">>\
	With a swift and irresistible movement, she slips her thumbs through the fabric of your <<print _u.name.toLowerCase()>>, and tugs them down. They slide off you in jerks, biting into your legs repeatedly with her rather forceful pull, but off they come.

	At the last, completely awkward moment, she tugs your panties down to your ankles and around your shoes, binding them like a bolo around your feet. You nearly lose your balance, but the gusset slips past and they spring free into her palm as you teeter to regain your footing.

	@@.femvoice6;“For my collection!”@@ she laughs, an unhinged look spreading across her face.

	She holds your panties above her head, dangling and waving them like a trophy.

	@@.femvoice6;“Tsk. Tsk,”@@ she laughs. @@.femvoice6;“You didn’t tell me you had a little secret. I’m not sure, but I think I like you even more now!”@@

	You feel utterly exposed.

	Suddenly you also become aware of the circle of people who have noticed your predicament. A ripple of cell phones rise around you, flash bursts confirming that your moment of humiliation is being recorded.

	Her mouth starts to form a word, and you see it coming before she even says it: @@.femvoice6;“Sissy.”@@

	You take a couple of awkward steps back, and make a run for it.

		You flee the dance floor and then the club entirely, ready to burst with humiliation. The noticeable draft under your dress reminds you at every step what you’ve just done.
		
		As you head out into the night air beyond the club’s outer door, it’s even worse. The sudden chill against your warmed-up skin makes your\

		You eventually make your way back home. When you arrive, the lights in the house are all out and your house is silent.

		That detail actually brings you a little relief. You know $guardian is always home by now and probably asleep, and the last thing you want is to explain any of what just happened to her.

		You quietly close the front door and lock it, thinking about the high chances that $guardian is sleeping soundly right now. A naughty thought crosses your mind when you feel the loose feeling around your privates where your surrendered underwear used to be.

		You wonder… What if I ‘borrow’ some of $guardian’s?

		However, you know there’s only one solution at this hour, and that’s borrowing a pair of $guardian’s. She’s probably sound asleep, but you sneak as quietly as you can to her door, just to make sure.
	<<endif>>\
	
	You listen carefully at her door until you’re confident she’s not awake. You decide to go for it, carefully turning the door handle, and easing the door ever-so-gently open. You then step inside as cautiously as possible, closing the door behind you just as quietly. You shut yourself in as a precaution, so nothing looks disturbed if she somehow wakes up.

	You’re relieved at the sound of her rhythmic, heavy breathing – she’s definitely out cold. That said, you’ve still got to find some of her underwear, and her room is pitch black.

	You carefully roll each step, heel-to-toe, moving inches at a time, trying to keep your feet as silent as possible. The plush carpeting in $guardian’s room helps considerably, but your heart nearly stops when a floorboard creaks unexpectedly and $guardian’s breathing changes up for a couple of cycles.

	She stays asleep, and you resume your best effort to find your way across the room. You strain to compare the layout of her room from your memory with the alien feeling of her furniture in the dark. You think you might be turned around, but you aren’t even sure of that.

	As you remember, her dresser is just on the wall opposite the doorway, and you think you might nearly be there. She keeps her underwear in the top drawer, but that drawer sometimes squeaks when it slides.

	On the other hand, you could go for her hamper, but that’s all the way on the other side of her bed. That would be no problem during the day, but in the dark, the trip might as well be a mile, and then you’ll also have to find your way back.

	[[Try to find her dresser|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="runAwayDresser"]]
	[[Look for her hamper|Task clubDancePanties][$scene="runAwayHamper"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "runAwayDresser">>\
	You take several more steps and find a solid corner belonging to a piece of furniture. You feel around, finding only solid paneling at first, so you try the opposite side. Your hand hits soft material and you feel $guardian’s foot, and you flinch away.

	You listen, not daring to breathe. You hear $guardian slide around under the covers a little, murmuring something. You’re terrified, sure you woke her up this time, but eventually her normal breathing pattern comes back. You’ve got to get this over with and get out of here!

	Holding on to the bed frame, you turn your back to the frame and take tiny steps forward, sweeping your hand in the darkness. After crossing what feels like an ocean of carpet, at last you locate the dresser.

	Feeling along the front edge until you find $guardian’s underwear drawer, you pull as slowly and delicately as you can on the drawer knobs. At first, there is no movement, but it finally begins to slide.

	The faint scent of $guardian’s perfume on her silky underthings is the first confirmation your search has been fruitful, but her drawer jams before it opens enough. You add as much force as you dare, trying to get the drawer to move, but you suffer through another tense moment before it slips past the bind.

	You think way too hard about how much room you need before you stop, expecting the drawer to squeak $guardian awake at any second. You need enough room to reach in and take something out without messing up her whole drawer, but closing the drawer again will be just as risky as opening it.

	You settle on opening it to about the length of your hand. You reach in, searching by feel for something you hope won’t be missed. While $guardian is not big on folding her lingerie, you’re not really sure how much she pays attention to what and where things are in there.

	In the end, you decide to take something from the bottom and hope for the best. To your surprise, the panties you pull out have a rubbery feel to them, and as they spring into an unfolded state, you realize you are holding a pair made from latex.

	You are a little scared to take these, because you have no idea if these are her only pair made from this material, and whether she will miss them immediately or not at all. That said, there is no way you can figure out how to fold them in the dark, nor can you put them back in without making a complete mess of $guardian’s drawer or making lots of noise. 

	You decide to ease the drawer closed. Luckily it slides in without any further drama, and you sneak your way out of the room.

	[[Go back to your room|Go to bedroom]]
<<elseif $scene eq "runAwayHamper">>\
	You wander in darkness, groping through empty air, the disconcerting sound of $guardian’s breathing seeming to come from all around you. You pad as lightly across the carpet as you can, hoping you don’t bounce a toe off the furniture in all this blackness – you can’t see a thing in here.

	Your thigh brushes against something hard, and after finding the object with your hands, you realize you’ve found the edge of the bed. It’s not where you expected, but having located it, it’s far easier to work your way to where $guardian’s hamper sits.

	The hamper is not quite where you remember, either, seemingly several steps beyond where it should be. You bump it as you locate it, causing the lid to clatter and the side to knock a bit against the wall.

	You freeze, listening intently for $guardian to react. The room goes completely quiet - not good. You think you hear her stirring, so you drop to the floor, just in time to avoid being caught in the light of a nightstand lamp that she switches on.

	As stealthily as you can, you roll against the edge of the bedframe, hiding yourself as best you can with a few of the nearby dangling covers. You know large parts of you are still exposed, but there’s nowhere to go, so you just hold your breath and stay as still as possible.

	Mere moments later, $Guardian’s bare feet appear right in front of you, then drop onto the carpet as she gets up. She narrowly misses stepping right on you, but doesn’t seem to have seen you… so far.

	She walks around the room, audibly opening and then closing the door to the hallway, then she goes over to her countertop sink. You heart the faucet run, accompanied by a few splashes and the sound of a cup being filled, drunk from and replaced.

	You hear her climb back into bed from the opposite side, and soon the lights go out again. You exhale slowly in silent relief, and then wait for an eternity until you’re absolutely certain she’s asleep again.

	When you finally feel brave enough to stand back up, you at least know where the hamper is this time, from when the light was on. You lift the lid soundlessly, then fish around inside until you find a set of $guardian’s discarded underwear. 

	This pair feels light and stringy, with the silky scratch of lace giving them away as one of $guardian’s racier, g-string panties. You hope that she won’t notice they’ve gone missing when she’s putting away the laundry next time. Still, the risk of being caught somehow adds to how turned on you are at holding them, catching a trace of $guardian’s feminine scent.

	Right now, however, you realize you need to get out of her room quickly before you miss your chance. Having gotten what you came for, you cautiously make your escape.
