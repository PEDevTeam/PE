	A few hours ahead of your evening out, you find the location of the upscale formal wear shop on the claim slip $teacher gave you, and go there to pick up your evening gown. It is floor-length, silky and the color of champagne, trimmed in damask lace, and a very elegant choice of ladies’ evening attire.

	A large hat box filled with accoutrements has also been provided, courtesy of $teacher. It contains a silk shaping slip, garter belt and thigh-length stockings, a pair of complementary d’orsay heels, a rose-gold collar necklace with matching bangle bracelets, and a small purse to complete your outfit.

	The shop is staffed with personal assistants who help you prepare for your evening out. They are remarkably discreet as they help you shed your clothing and help you into the slip, gown and accessories. Your clothing is carefully pinned, padded and arranged to compliment your body shape and present it in the most feminine way possible.

	To your surprise, the preparations don’t end with your merely being dressed. You are shown to a large, padded stylist’s chair, where the preparation for your evening out continues under the care of a trio of stylists.

	You are spritzed lightly with perfume at each step, then groomed, depilated and powdered. Your feet and hands are soaked, pumice-stoned, and cuticle-trimmed, then each of your nails is manicured and pedicured with tasteful nude polish, accented with a thin band of gold leafing.

	Your attending trio expertly applies foundation, shade, color and mascara to your face, while also seeing to your hair. You feel tugging and pinching at your scalp as temporary extensions are threaded into place, followed by interminable amounts of styling. Even your teeth are seen to, leaving your mouth with a clean, minty feeling.

	When you emerge from your chair, you are ushered towards a full-length, three-way mirror to see the results. Though you’ve become more than slightly familiar with looking like a girl in recent times, you aren’t quite prepared for this – your reflection is simply astonishing.

	There is nothing half-measured or drag-like about it: You look like a beautiful, refined lady. Your flowing gown drapes perfectly over the curves of your body – both real and augmented – and from your perfectly-coifed, up-do style to the dainty tips of your shoes, there is not one unconvincing aspect of your appearance.

	Even your gait is feminine. Your dress and heels restrict your stride; in order to balance, you find you naturally adopt a swaying motion that keeps your steps in line and over the shoes’ pedestals.

	You are notified that your belongings have been sent home for you, and you’re sent on your way with the best wishes of the staff. As you emerge from the store, you capture the center of attention of every passer-by, and it is evident that the shop knows its business.

	At curbside, a spotlessly shiny black sedan limousine is waiting to whisk you to your destination.

	Despite yourself, you feel beautiful; it’s the only way to describe it as you catch the reflection of yourself in your dress in the gleam of the limo door. As the driver opens the car for you, you’re confronted with the nagging question of why $teacher has suddenly gone to all this trouble on your behalf.

	[[Go to the club|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="inClub"; $time.hour=21]]
<<elseif $scene eq "inClub">>\
	Your limo arrives directly at the club entrance, where the typical club noise, bouncers and lengthy queue are just as they always are. This time, however, the bouncers get the door for you, lending a hand to help you step up from your passenger seat, and usher you past the waiting crowds to the guest entrance of the club’s upscale restaurant. 

	You’re addressed as ‘ma’am’ by the entire staff, who extend you VIP courtesy. Upon your entering, the maître d’ greets you at the door, welcoming you with much more than typical politeness. She escorts you personally to the large, central table where your dining companion awaits, and calls another waiter over to see to your chair before wishing you a pleasant dinner.

	Your companion, a man in a black tuxedo jacket with a bowtie, stands at your arrival. He is a silver fox type in his early forties, handsome and fit, though slightly weathered. He has the sturdy build, tidy grooming and upright posture of an ex-pro athlete or military man, though he’s too genteel to be either one. By his manners and through details like his bespoke luxury watch and the diamond cufflinks and studs on his tuxedo, you gauge that he is acclimated to living with the fine and formal.

	The table itself is appointed for royalty. The settings include crystal stemware and fine china, and intricate gold inlays accent the silverware. The fine linen tablecloth is silky to the touch, draping nearly to the floor, and a tasteful centerpiece made of finely blown glass twinkles with the soft glow of a fire bowl within.

	[[Have a seat|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="haveSeat"]]
<<elseif $scene eq "haveSeat">>\
	After you sit, a waiter helps you place your linen napkin, provides you with a menu, fills your glass and departs. Your companion sips from an amber glass of aged scotch. He introduces himself only as Mr. J.

	@@.mrJ;“I am a… colleague of $teacher, and she’s told me quite a bit about you,”@@ Mr. J says. @@.mrJ;“She failed to adequately describe how lovely you are. I’m actually at a loss for words. I guess I expected someone like yourself… forgive me, I’ve misspoken. I should just say, you certainly make quite the lady.@@

	@@.mrJ;“I’m sure she hasn’t told you very much about me, but I’m afraid for the time being that’s how things will have to stay.@@

	@@.mrJ;“That said, please enjoy yourself. Order anything you want. Live a little. Tonight has a lot of promise.”@@

	You open the menu. You quickly see that it’s far different from those you’re used to in the restaurants $guardian can afford. Two things stand out – first, there are no prices, and second, most of the menu choices are in languages other than English. The descriptions of each item are very short, leaving lots of white space around them, and what they do offer includes gourmet ingredients you barely recognize. You have no idea where to begin.

	Seeing your obvious confusion, Mr. J takes the menu from you.

	@@.mrJ;“Leave that to me,”@@ he says, looking at you rather avidly. @@.mrJ;“I’ve never had a single disappointing thing brought to this table.”@@

	At a nod from Mr. J, the waiter arrives. You don’t understand most of what he orders in the exchange that follows, but based on the genuine compliments he gets from the waiter, Mr. J has a keen understanding of the best the restaurant offers.

	As you wait for your meal together, Mr. J proves to be a skilled conversationalist. Though he reveals nothing of substance about himself, he carries an engaging and entertaining discussion without once making you feel stupid or unsophisticated. You are nevertheless left keenly aware you are far out of your league.

	Your meal arrives in courses, and each is perfectly portioned for its timing. You don’t even know the names of anything in front of you, but Mr. J gives you help with finding the appropriate use for each of the 12 pieces of silverware in your place setting, and introduces each dish with an expert’s ability to reduce the complex into clear terms.

	True to his word, Mr. J has ordered well, and your dinner is bursting with incredible flavors and textures. Overtones of sweet and savory are tinted by hints of bitter or spice that are not just delicious, but have sublime timing of initial, peak and aftertastes that make each bite something special. Your palette is teased, refreshed, cleansed and sated in turn. It may well be the best meal you’ve ever tasted.

	Despite the peculiar circumstances of it, you can’t help but wonder at how undeniably amazing this evening has been. You wonder if this is what fairy tale princesses would feel like – surrounded in luxury, elegance and beauty. You never aspired to be the princess in those stories, but you feel like you’ve been handed a chance to step out of your whole life for a night. Still, an unsettling, vague feeling nags at you.

	As you finish your last course, a waiter brings you an arm-length, cream-colored box, wrapped in a cross of brown satin ribbon that has been hand-tied in a large, intricate bow.

	Its gift tag is addressed to you, with no sender, but the waiter is gone before you have a chance to ask about it.

	[[Open the Box|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="openBox"; $time.hour=22]]
<<elseif $scene eq "openBox">>\
	You pull the ribbon, releasing the bow, and open the box’s cap top. A dozen long-stem red roses are inside, with a card, and at first you think this might be some romantic finale from your companion.

	But inside, there’s also a small, digital timer counting down from 5 minutes.

	The card is written in anonymous, computer-printed letters, but you immediately realize it’s from $teacher. It reads:

	@@.teacher;‘I do hope you enjoyed your evening. Now, it’s time for your lesson: You have 5 minutes to go down on your dinner companion and make him climax, or you fail. Don’t leave the table until after you’re done, or you fail.

	‘Given the lavish expense you’ve enjoyed, should you fail, the consequences will be especially severe.’@@

	@@.hero;Shit.@@

	You feel like the floor just fell out from under you. Without any change in appearance, all the luxury around you has suddenly transformed into a prison. You look around the restaurant, expecting to see $teacher sitting across from you, laughing. You don’t, of course, but the timer is still counting away.

	You meet Mr. J’s gaze, and you immediately see he was expecting this. He doesn’t do anything untoward, but a subtle, malign change in his eyes tells you everything you need to know.

	You realize you have to make a choice, and quickly.

	[[Climb under the table|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="underTable"]]
	[[Go for the exit|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="goExit"; $time.hour=23]]
<<elseif $scene eq "underTable">>\
	<div><<RandomImageFromPack "Club Under Table" 600 600>></div>\
	Taking the timer in hand, you try your best to pick a moment when no one is looking, but your table happens to be in the center of a very busy dining room. You catch a moment where it seems like most of the surrounding tables are either engrossed in conversation or talking with the wait staff. Time is ticking.

	You drop to the carpet and crawl under the tablecloth, which turns out to be a difficult and uncomfortable feat when wearing a formal gown and heels. Once you’re under the table, you have to hike your dress and shaping slip above your knees to be able to move to Mr. J’s seat, and both garments crackle with the pop of tearing seams. Then, your stockings snag on the carpet as you crawl, shredding at the knees and absorbing runs down their entire length.

	You reach Mr. J, lifting the table cloth as covertly as you can over his lap. He moves to accommodate you, slouching a little to give you access. A glance at the timer shows that over a minute has already passed since the flowers arrived, and despite your misgivings, you know the remaining time will be gone faster than you might need it to.

	Mr. J’s clothes are well-tailored, and his fly easily unzips. As you pull out his cock, you’re horrified to find that it’s both long and girthy, even in its partially erect state, easily spanning the distance from your fingertips to the base of your wrist. You take hold of the base of Mr. J’s shaft in your hand. You note, oddly, how your manicured fingers looking surprisingly small and feminine by comparison as you begin.

	You thrust your mouth over as much of him as will fit, using your tongue as best you can to lubricate his member. You swirl your tongue around the head, lapping it insistently and trying to provide as much stimulation as you can. You’re rewarded by a rapid swelling as he grows erect, but your mouth is almost completely filled before it’s finished.

	You start to suck in earnest, bobbing your head to push the substantially-sized cockmeat in and out of your mouth. Mr. J reaches beneath the table and adds a hand to the top of your head, helping to control your rhythm and pressure, but you find that nothing makes it easier to get him to fit.

	Several more minutes pass, with your mouth descending further and further down his shaft as your jaw begins to stretch. Guttural sounds involuntarily emanate from your throat when his head penetrates it. Forcing back your gag reflex, your eyes start watering and you breathe hard through your nose as he begins to thrust his hips a little to drive himself even further home. The hand on your head starts to assert some force, and you struggle to keep up.

	Watching the timer creep perilously downward, you increase your pace as much as you can. Stars appear in your vision and you start to swoon and withdraw, but your mouth is once again impaled after a hard push on your head. With his deep-throated cock leaving you no way to swallow, you feel your saliva flowing over your chin, and the tears flow down your face in earnest.

	Just as blackness starts to iris over your vision, Mr. J pulls you backwards and his cock slips from your mouth. With only seconds left on the timer, you struggle to take him back inside, but he tenses up and holds you still with a painful, unyielding grip on your hair. You have only realized for an instant that you’ve succeeded in making him cum, when you see his cock start to visibly twitch in front of you.

	<<if $kinkAllow.bukkake>>\
		You can do nothing as the first splatter of hot semen shoots up your cheek, over your nose, and into your hair. The blast is followed by several more syrupy bursts that thoroughly coat your cheeks, lips and eyebrows. With no way for you to avoid it, cum flows down your face, into your mouth, onto your chest and gown, and down your arm.
	<<else>>\
		At the last moment, Mr. J forces his cock back in. You feel his cock pulsing violently as he climaxes, but your throat and tongue are so desensitized from being face-fucked that you barely notice as he shoots his load directly into your esophagus. A few splashes of cum backflow and drip out of your mouth along with unrestrained saliva, dribbling quickly over your chin as you struggle for breath.
	<<endif>>\

	The timer finally ends. There’s no chime or alarm - it simply begins to flash ’00:00’ as you watch helplessly, feeling rivulets of semen and saliva drip off you. You are at zero.

	At last, Mr. J lets go of your hair. As you watch beneath the tablecloth, he zips himself up and slides his chair back. He drops his napkin on the floor near his chair, then gets up and leaves.

	[[Try to clean yourself up|Task clubDinnerGown][$scene="cleanUp"; $time.addMinutes(5)]]
<<elseif $scene eq "cleanUp">>\
	In less than five minutes, you have been reduced to a total wreck. 

	Tears pour down your cheeks as you grab the leftover napkin and shake it to try to get the tiny bits of food off. You wipe yourself off as much as you can, but it’s not much use. 

	Though it’s dimly lit under the table, you see that your gown is lined with damp, vertical streaks, white and obvious in nature, and well-soiled by stains of running make-up. Your stockings are a total loss, with bare skin showing through rips everywhere, and the side seam of your gown along your leg has also torn. Your hair has come untressed, and you can tell from the streaks of mascara and lipstick on the napkin that your makeup has been rendered a runny mess.

	You continue hiding under the table for several more minutes, legs akimbo, trying to figure out what to do, but there’s nothing for it. As the feet and carts of the bussing staff appear next to the table, you realize that the only thing more embarrassing than getting up like this and leaving the dining room now, would be getting caught under here by the next party they seat.

	Once the table is cleared, you take off your heels and slip under the tablecloth, into the light. As you stand up in your ruined gown, holding your shoes, the chatter at the tables around you stops as other diners catch sight of you. A few gasps and shocked comments follow, but most of the patrons simply stare in disbelief at you as you walk out of the restaurant in shame.

	There is no further VIP treatment. The staff steps out of your way, barely hiding their disgust. You exit the club. 

	The limo is, naturally, nowhere in sight. The walk home is one of the longest of your life.

	[[Go home|Go to bedroom][$tasksTeacher.clubDinnerGown.status=2; playerCode.getNaked()]]
<<elseif $scene eq "goExit">>\
	You have been asked to do many things by $teacher, but this one takes the prize. There is no way you are going to give a blowjob to a stranger here, in front of everyone, in an upscale restaurant. While you know $teacher is going to punish you for walking away, you have a hard time imagining something that would surpass the degradation of going through with this task.

	You politely thank Mr. J for the evening, leave your napkin on the table, and get up. He makes no effort to stop you, but a foreboding look from him leaves you with an unsettling thought:

	What exactly did $teacher mean when she said the consequences will be ‘especially severe?’

	As you leave the club, the limo is, naturally, nowhere to be seen. You make your way home on your own and take quick shower.
