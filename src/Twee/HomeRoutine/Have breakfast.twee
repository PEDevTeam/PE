			$Guardian leans toward you and whispers conspiratorially, @@.guardian;"I have something special for you."@@ For a tiny moment, you recall one of your fantasies featuring her, letting yourself indulge in a fleeting hope of wish fulfillment.

			She walks out of the kitchen for a bit and returns with a skateboard. It's not just any skateboard, either: it's the most coveted deck on the market right now, with a cool tribal design, top-of-the-line trucks and the best ceramic bearings you can buy. It's obvious she spent both time and some good money getting it.

			But you can't keep the disappointment off your face - why did she have to get //this// one?
			
			It's not that you didn't dream about owning a board like this, maybe as recently last year. Hell, you might still love to skate with it, even if you haven't done any riding for some time.

			The thing is, not too long ago, a punk classmate of yours - one of $bully's inner circle - lost a skateboard. Since you were already his favorite target, $bully wasted no time accusing you of stealing it.

			You shudder, remembering how $bully and his asshole friends ganged up on you and surrounded you, cruelly interrogating you as their main suspect. They were out for blood. The bruises you got while getting away from them lasted for days. Eventually, the rumor died out and $bully went back to his normal level of douchery, but nobody ever found out what really happened to the board.

			The skateboard in $guardian's hands looks //just like the one $bully's friend lost.//

			You probably could repaint it or something, but if you were ever seen with it by those punks and they figured it out, you'd be a dead man.
			
			Seeing your fallen face, $guardian's smile falters @@.guardian;"Sorry, I just thought that you liked this stuff. I should have asked."@@
			
			It isn't her fault, and you really don't want her to feel bad about it, so you hurry to reassure her. Embarrassed to admit your cowardice, you make up a story that your friend had a bad fall while skating and doesn't skate anymore, so you don't want to remind your friend about that.
			
			$Guardian nods and agrees it's unfortunate, but you feel like she sees right through your thin story. You can tell she's just as disappointed as you are, and probably thinks you just don't want to be rude about a bad gift. 

			She says she'll figure out what to do with the skateboard and promises she'll try to find something more to your liking next time. You feel a little guilty about it, but you're genuinely thankful she went to all the effort to make you happy.
