:: Uniform Punishment - Steal
Glancing around to check if anyone is watching, you snatch a uniform off the rack and sneak into the changing room. Before you lose your nerve, you strip off your current outfit to change into the "new" uniform and carefully remove all the tags you can find.

You can't help but look at yourself in the mirror. The outfit is actually fairly modest, though the skirt seems a little on the short side, but... well... from the colorful tartan skirt and tie to the fitted jacket it is unmistakably feminine.

<<if playerCode.isMind_2()>>\
    You can't help but smile at your reflection, you look so cute! You're struggling to think why you didn't get a uniform like this sooner...
<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\
    As much as you may try to deny it the new outfit well... you just look somehow better than with your usual male uniform. You can't quite put your finger on why but there's just something about the feminine outfit that seems to really compliment your figure.
<<else>>\
    You hate your reflection and yet you can't stop staring. The face is you and yet... from the neck down you'd swear you were looking at a girl... a cute girl.
<</if>>\

You bid adieu to your previous outfit, as you lack anything carry it in that wouldn't attract attention, and muster your courage. Taking a deep breath, you step out of the changing room to make your escape.

[[Sneak out|Uniform Punishment - Caught]]


:: Uniform Punishment - Caught
Nervously walking out of the changing room wearing your pilfered outfit, you make it across the room without anyone paying you any mind. Your heart races as you figure you've done it!

As you step through the door out of the shop, the alarm goes off loudly.

You freeze. A mall cop is already approaching from one direction, but before you can consider running, a hand grasps you from behind.

@@.shopclothes;"Well, well, well, what do we have here? I know you didn't walk in wearing that, so what is this... Are you trying to steal that fetching uniform?"@@

<<if $flags.metClothesClerk == true>>\
    Turning around, you find yourself looking at $guardian's friend Susan, who takes one look at your outfit and smiles demonically.
<<else>>\
    Looking up, you realize that you've seen her before, a friend of $guardian, as you recall. You note her name tag says "Susan," as she takes a single, lingering glance over your outfit and slowly smiles.
<<endif>>\

Puffing a bit, the guard appears next to you and asks if he can be of assistance.

@@.shopclothes;"No, no, everything is quite alright. Silly me, I I seem to have forgotten to remove one of the tags when I sold this lovely lady her new outfit! We're just going to head back in and take care of that, but thank you very much officer for your swift response."@@

The cop tips his hat to the both of you and then walks away as Susan drags you back into the shop.

@@.shopclothes;"Come along. my little thief. Stealing a school uniform, a WOMEN's uniform no less... my my my... Still, I'm sure $guardian would be rather distressed to hear what you've been up to in my shop. Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. You do me a teensy little favor, and we'll just forget about this whole thing. I'll even let you walk right out wearing your cute new outfit. Oh, and I don't care if you could have actually afforded it. Simply paying for the items doesn't excuse your attempt at shoplifting. Your only way to avoid a trip to the security office is to do exactly as I ask..."@@

Susan seems to relish your nervous fear, and your mind races in anticipation as she circles you like a shark, inspecting your newly female-uniformed self from all sides before nodding and motioning for you to follow.

Back in the store proper, you suddenly feel as if all eyes are on you, especially when you spot a cluster of girls. You don't recognize them from your school, thank god, but they're your same age and your heart pounds as you hope they don't look in your direction...

Unfortunately, Susan has something else in mind, heading directly for the pack of young women with you dutifully in tow.

@@.shopclothes;"Good afternoon, ladies"@@ she states in greeting. @@.shopclothes;"Is there anything we could do to be of service? My lovely assistant here is available to model anything in the store for you. Right now, I have her in a brand new school uniform. A bit dull, perhaps, but doesn't it look just fetching on her?"@@

You're mortified, especially as you hear one of the girls lean over to whisper, @@.femvoice5;"Doesn't that look sort of like $player.name from Pepperton?"@@ Suddenly, a memory flashes in your mind of meeting her on a multi-school field trip, and your face turns a deep crimson.

The girls initially thank Susan and decline and the two of you start to walk away as a feeling of relief washes over you. Unfortunately, you've barely taken a few steps when one of the girls calls out. @@.femvoice5;"Actually, miss... we changed our mind. There's a few things that we'd just love to see modelled for us."@@

@@.hero;This can't be happening... This can't be happening...@@ You think, but it is. Robot-like, you follow Susan back to a large dressing room with the cluster of girls in tow. A fearful glance over your shoulder shows that the girls are snatching clothes off the rack as they follow behind you.

Shoved behind a partition, you are handed a tube top and a skirt, Susan giving you a parting smile with just enough menace to communicate the consequences if you don't go through with this little fashion show.

Staring down at the new outfit, you are momentarily petrified. Sure, you don't technically know any of the girls out there, but being paraded in front of them this way is still humiliating.

@@.femvoice5;"Come on, it doesn't take that long to change!"@@ One of them shouts, breaking the spell and causing you to hurriedly start stripping out of the school uniform.

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><<RandomImageFromPack "Mall Laughing Girls" 400 400>></div>\
Stepping back, you find yourself staring at a half dozen grinning girls, plus Susan. Not satisfied for you to stand there, they call out for you to twirl around, walk in a circle and otherwise show off your skimpy outfit. Blushing up a storm, you're actually relieved when one of the girls hands you another set of clothes, as it gives you the opportunity to quickly dart back behind the partition, grateful for a moments reprieve from the humiliation.

What follows next is a seemingly endless parade of embarrassment. Under Susan's watchful eye, you change into outfit after outfit. No sooner have you stepped out from behind the small privacy screen and shown off one ensemble, when one of the girls hands you a fresh outfit even more scandalous than the last.

Teetering in heels, gasping in too-tight shapewear or struggling to keep yourself from being exposed in the shortest of miniskirts, it is all you can do just to keep up with their demands. For their part, the girls have an uproariously good time at your expense, laughing and cavorting with glee as they order you to strut like a fashion model, then eagerly sending you back to change into something else.

Finally, just when you think it can't possibly get any worse, they declare a "bonus" swimsuit round. You struggle mightily to keep the little //surprise// between your legs from being noticed as you pose in a too-small one-piece and then a series of increasingly skimpy bikinis. Standing in a two-piece that has less combined fabric than a handkerchief, trembling in fear at what the devilish girls might come up with next, when Susan announces, @@.shopclothes;"unfortunately, the shop is closing soon and we have a bit of cleanup to attend to."@@

Expressing sorrow at the end to their "fun", the girls thank you and Susan for the wonderful show and file out, a couple even buying some of the outfits you posed in! You can't even think what you'd do if you saw one of them wearing it around town, and you're suddenly //very// thankful for your private school and its strict dress code.

Speaking of school outfits, you somehow blush anew when Susan hands you your new uniform with a smile. @@.shopclothes;"Payment for a job well done,"@@ she says with a smile. @@.shopclothes;"Get changed so you can help me put all this stuff away."@@

Back in the school uniform, which feels positively mundane after the slutty fashion show you just performed, you find out that "help" means "do all the work, while I supervise."

Susan has you put back every item of clothing you tried on, each piece like salt in a wound as it triggers yet another embarrassing memory.

Thanking you once more for your help, Susan has you gather up your things and bids you goodbye. Exhausted by your ordeal, you wonder if it was really all worth saving a mere $<<print window.itemFuncs.getItemByVariant('school_female_00').price>>? @@.hero;It's too late now.@@ You think as you exit the store.
