THIS MACRO IS WRITTEN BUT IS NOT IN USE SINCE THE ACCEPTANCE SYSTEM IS NOT USED
Documentation for the acceptance macro

"Real programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand." - Anon

It should however not be hard to use :-)

To be able to easily present different versions of scenes depending on
various acceptance values you can use the acceptance macro.

<<acceptance acceptance-key>>
<<between 0 10>> Text and code for values between 0 and 10 inclusive
<<between 5 25>> Text and code for values between 5 and 25 inclusive
<<between 20 50>> Text and code for values between 20 and 50 inclusive
<<defaultAccept>> Text and code for all other acceptance values
<</acceptance>>

Acceptance-key is any of (real list should be supplied by AprilRyan):
submission
exhibition
crossdressing
bisexuality
maleOral
femaleOral
maleAnal
femaleAnal
selfAnal

If the acceptance-key is not defined (for example is you spell it
wrong, like mailOral), the macro will print:

mailOral is not an acceptance type



The <<between>> caluses can be overlapping (as in the example above)
but they don't have to be.  If they are overlapping, the macro will
randomly choose from those clauses that match the acceptance value.

If no matching <<between>> clause is found, the text and code of the
<<defaultAccept>> clause is used.  If there is no <<defaultAccept>>,
nothing is used.

The clauses can be in any order but for readability, please have them
in increasing acceptance values.  Place the <<defaultAccept>> clause
where appripriate, beginning, end, or the middle.

Example where it is appropriate to have it at the beginning:

<<accaptance acceptance-key>>
<<defaultAccept>> Between clauses only start at 50
<<between 50 80>> Text and code for values between 50 and 80 inclusive
<<between 70 100>> Text and code for values between 70 and 100 inclusive
<</acceptance>>
