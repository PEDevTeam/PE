It should however not be hard to use :-)

This macro allows you to have something happen only once if a
condition is true.  Think of teacher, guardian and friend reacting to
the PC getting a new haircut for example.

<<reactOnce boolean_expression flag>>
    If boolean_expression is true and State.active.variables.once.flag
    is false, set flag to true and show this section. It will only be
    shown once.
<</reactOnce>>

Example:
<<reactOnce $body.earsPierced friendNoticePiercingEars>>\
    $friend reaches forward to your chin, and gently turns your head to the side. @@.friend;"You got your ears pierced!  The young folk of today, eh?  What is the world coming to?"@@ $friendG.He_She grins at you.  @@.friend;"They look good on you $player.name."@@
<</reactOnce>>

When the boolean expression is not just a test on a boolean variable you have to use back-ticks like this:
<<reactOnceMore `$body.hairstyle eq 2` friendNoticeHairMedium>>\
    $friend notices your new hair style. @@.friend;"That's a new look for you. I think it suits you $player.name."@@
<</reactOnce>>\

`$body.hairstyle eq 2` is evaluated before the parsing of the
arguments to the macro. The value becomes the first argument to the
macro.

For certain flags (like friendNoticeBreastsDD) it is implied that
there will be no reactions to the 'lesser' flags afterwards.  If
guardian has already reacted to DD-boobs, she will not reacto to
B-boobs (even if she have never noticed them before).

<<reactOnce `$body.boobs eq 4` friendNoticeBreastsDD friendNoticeBreastsC friendNoticeBreastsB>>
    This will be shown if $body.boobs is 4 and friendNoticeBreastsDD is not true.
    friendNoticeBreastsDD, friendNoticeBreastsC, and friendNoticeBreastsB will
    all be set to true.
<</reactOnce>>

Usually there is a long sequence of possible reactions (like in Friend
reaction to transformations.twee) so there is a <<reactOnceMore>> clause.

<<reactOnce boolean_expression flag>>
    If boolean_expression is true and State.active.variables.once.flag
    is false, set flag to true and show this text
<<reactOnceMore boolean_expression flag>>
    Same as above, all reactOnce and reactOnce more caluses will be tested
    (and possibly executed).
<</reactOnce>>

Finally there can be a <<reactElse>> clause.  It is excecuted if none
of the reactOnce or reactOnceMore clauses have been triggered.


So the full form can be
<<reactOnce boolean_expression flag optional_flags>>
    ...
<<reactOnceMore boolean_expression flags optional_flags>>
    ...


<<reactElse>>
    ...
<</reactOnce>>
